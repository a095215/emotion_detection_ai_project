ok but the number one language to learn if you wanna be a billionaire is C because then when your tech startup inevitably becomes the next apple you can write the entire backend in C just to screw with any future employees

‘If you want to make money in the 2020s learn COBOL’<br><br>As a 38 year old COBOL dev who’s been doing it for 18 years…yep that still holds true. It rots your brain for other languages and using a terminal emulator sucks ass, but the money is there because if you’re young and not retiring any time soon, you can learn from the people and take up their mantle.

You need to know 3 languages (FE, BE/middleware, DB), and at least one of their respective frameworks, in order to be productive in today&#39;s software development industry. <br>That means being proficient in at least 6 languages. <br>Oh, and you have to keep up with their changes over the years. <br>And if you move to another company with a different tech stack, MORE LEARNING.<br>GOOD LUCK!!!
bastards
You have made some mistakes regarding the documentation of C++ in your video. Like it appeared already in 1985 and not 1986 as you showcase in your video. Also it was developed by a Dane and not an American. You even showcase one of his quotes in your video.
I have seen your videos for the first time and they are really good. Thanks for making these.
best programming language is js, and next learn html and css (only for web development) my recommend programming to code is python and Java
I think you missed logic compilers like verilog hdl or vhdl
What about MATLAB?
Machine code is the hardest, but easy if user control is beast. additionally machine code has unli power, but if harness properly it became unstoppable.
Guys are all of the logos of the programming language half-life
did you know that rust is made with rust itself

&quot;Or maybe I never came out of that ayahuasca trip I took 10 years ago&quot; LOL
C++ my only bible
I was bewildered in my first year as a junior dev when a grizzled old dev said &quot;don&#39;t tell anybody but I know cobol&quot;, cause I thought it was neat he knew such an old language. But then I found out what it means to know Cobol: they never let you do anything else. You&#39;re too valuable to waste on projects with sexy new programming languages and technologies. Back to the cobol mines maintaining systems as old as your parents. Though in this economy that kind of job security is probably nice.
Back in my day you learned quick basic, pascal, C++, Java, C, Perl, C#, SQL, then html, css and some JS...then PHP, probably some other stuff...oh yeah, IBM Assembly and Motorola Assembly

Ericsson developed erlang as an alternative to using Tandem (now Nonstop) and it was the messaging framework behind telephony and financial interchanges. So you’re wrong there, but adjacent to the full story, which is an interesting one.
💖😊
I started with Baltie, then scratch, then C++, then IT middle school ;D
Just wanna say, after this video i went into a rabbit hole so deep that now i understand binary, know to correlate it with the ascii table and read or write in 0 and 1 in my mind :D     AND  the weirdest part is that we are made of 0 and 1 our genes express or not express, literally.     Its so weird how computers are made in such way that reflect our way of thinking but at the speed of light
Julia can also supposedly cross compile with C, C++, and Python. Julia can function as both a scripting language and a compiled language AFIK.
regarding the philosophical ending and conciseness, I had an epiphany a few days ago. It’s a bit long but fuck it. <br><br>The philosophical dilemma I have been questioning for many many years, is simple, how can we define what is morally right or wrong. This may seem simple, but it’s really not. Our sense of right/wrong changes as we age and differs among cultures. A kid first things right/wrong is what their parents decide, then teachers, cops, government, etc. then some people (not all) understand that it’s very difficult to define what is right/wrong. I know what you’re thinking, what the hell does this have to do with consciousness, just bear with me.<br><br>Well here’s my theory. Right/wrong is always determined by the observer performing the action/inaction. As an example, what may be right to me (stealing your food because I’m starving) may seem wrong to you (someone stole your food, that person is a thief). So who’s right in this situation from an outside perspective? A reasonable person would ascertain that they both are right and wrong, depending on the perspective. Which is why right/wrong is ALWAYS determined from the observer’s perspective.<br><br>Now we come to a deeper question, what is the purpose of even designating something as right/wrong? It is a purely “human” concept if you think about it. Lower animals just act, a lion doesn’t care that it ate a baby gazelle, he doesn’t even have the capacity to question what is right/wrong. His only thought is hungry, eat. This may not seem profound, but it is. The lion performed the action for survival. If you think about it, he did the right thing, had he not hunted he would have starved. He did it because he was hungry. A negative experience is seen as suffering and being a hungry lion is suffering. <br><br>Now we can make another jump, is the reduction of suffering not a survival instinct? We are nothing more than dna, trying to replicate itself. It’s difficult for us to think of situations in this manner: this will reduce my survival chances/ability to keep my dna alive. We though, instinctively DO have a measuring stick of what does or doesn’t increase/decrease the survival of our dna and that is our ability to SUFFER. <br><br>People are lazy for the most part and do what is easy. To reduce suffering is easy and people will naturally choose, the reduce suffering option. With this new info, we can make the jump to define what is right/wrong: right is the action/inaction that reduces suffering and wrong is the action that increases suffering (technically, it’s survival of our DNA, but we use suffering as a measuring stick). <br><br>An animal’s ability to deduce the likelihood of suffering is directly correlated to their consciousness. In order for an animal to even register suffering, they must have a sense of self. To be conscious of suffering, is to be conscious itself. This is how consciousness came to be. For us to survive, we must be able to comprehend “I’m in pain, I’m hungry, etc” and that requires the formation of identity. The more intelligent the animal, the more capable it is of reducing suffering, and therefore the more conscious it is. <br><br>I know I didn’t do the best job explaining it, but hopefully I got the point across. This is my own theory that I came up with.<br><br><br>I want to add that this mechanism we use to determine right/wrong is the building block of our societies, cultures, and laws. Think of it as binary, even with just simple 1s and 0s, complex systems can be created. What is right/wrong other than 1s and 0s?

I can recommend OpenMOSA project, which is C# compiler and operating system written in C#. Because fuck iceberg, we can go deep as you want.
Most don&#39;t consider sql a programming language.
WHAT HAVE YOU DONE!!! NOTHING IS EVERYTHING NOW!!!
Very bottom of the iceberg: <br>CREATE YOUR OWN PROGRAMMING LANGUAGE
I am waiting till someone make a programming language based on 6th grade level English 😂
worst thing you can do; is learn multiple languages and not being proficient in any of them. Learn a language that will benefit you until you become advanced, for most software/ai/data all you need is SQL+Python+javascript if you complement it with knowledge in cloud computing and basic bash/linux/devops that&#39;s really all you need today. Don&#39;t waste your time learning other languages only to forget them soon after like I did.
warum hat bei mir Moneyboy das Thumbnail vorgelesen? ICEBERG
All of which is listed for an entery level job with 5 YOE
programming has become so cringe. network and communications is really cool tho
lll are the best period! (java was my first language, c is my second and i hate when they tell my use python for class projects)
I don&#39;t get it, do we hate or love php? 😅
I’ve been inspired to stop procrastinating and make myself suffer by making code on my phone Ty very much
I was waiting for the king of languages, turns out I just had to wait till the end for Holy C
Notice Perl&#39;s logo, but he doesn&#39;t really talk about it? It&#39;s the language that&#39;s everywhere, yet hidden and no one talks about.
Hilariously my college started us with python, then immediately switched to c++ after 1 class and we learned it very well.
Where is Matlab??
Meanwhile me working on verilog
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pEfrdAtAmqk&amp;t=460">7:40</a> funny that whenever c++ is critized, they talk about it like its year 1990. It evolved so much, that nobody uses new/delete anymore but smart pointers. Why the ignorance?
Languages you want to learn: javascript (html and css arent programming languages but learn them), python, sql, lua(for game dev), java (this is a must even if you hate it), c, c++, command line (if you can remotely call this programming) and thats about it.
Another thing. Lua is also found in a Steam Game called Project Zomboid. Y&#39;all should check it out.
QBasic was  my first programming language when I was starting my teens
I studie Informatik and the First Language that we learn was Scratch(First 2 weeks) and Java(Main Language) I like Java Actually. I come from C# and C++ so there were some difficullties but I like it. :)
I don’t think scratch is even a programming language
Im trying to learn java to get rich on apps. Why not kotlin? Because its too late to go back now.
bro use a DeEsser for your voice
Hah sneaking in a Kent Hompson huh!
luas embedded in garrys mod aswell
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pEfrdAtAmqk&amp;t=398">6:38</a> That compiles to WHAT?
Bro forgot Lua, it&#39;s weird in it&#39;s own way.
My first code was written in C++, so I&#39;m forever biased towards it.
Damn, I&#39;m superior to all of you (i only know Python)
C has hashmaps, it&#39;s called malloc...
You know what other language also has functions? C!
HTML is NOT a programming language, it&#39;s a markup language!
Nr 1 programming language to learn: C
C++ and Lua is my favorite pair, being able to take advantage of how optimized C++ is but also being able to use some of the nicer features Lua offers because you can add them to each other<br><br>Although that’s probably not a super popular take, also that kinda comes out of them being the only 2 coding languages I know how to use well

Just started learning Python from scratch a few weeks ago thanks to watching this vid last year and being inspired to learn it after not touching it for 10 years. I still don&#39;t understand many things about programming but I love watching your vids. Much love! Oh btw <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pEfrdAtAmqk&amp;t=106">1:46</a> 0! is just 1 so error is not needed lol
Where does LabView fit?
C/C++ is goated for me
Where does Perl fit in this?
I&#39;m old, so I&#39;ve done Basic, Pascal, Fortran, Cobol, assembly language and even pure machine code on punch cards, but I still find it hard to understand some &quot;modern&quot; terms like &quot;API&quot;. It&#39;s all getting lost in fancy words and equally fancy letter combinations, so you can impress everybody else. &quot;Please do...&quot; I like that.<br><br>Excellent video. Memory Lane.
Dang RPG not even mentioned
it&#39;s okay to say fuck on the internet
Existential crisis jumpscare was out of pocket
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pEfrdAtAmqk&amp;t=917">15:17</a> the transistors used to store bits in the RAM actually consist of 2 or more logic gates and each logic gate consists of 2(NOT gate) or 3(AND and OR gates) transistors. The most basic designs are of “flip-flops” and “latches”. So saying that the voltage being 0V(for 0) and usually 5V(for 1) in a single transistor represents a single bit is not factually correct as many transistors are involved for representing a single bit.
I’ve learned python, the basics of c++, now I’m learning JavaScript html and css, and after that hopefully rust 😊
omg love your stuff. your hilarious.
♥the only thing i know is i know nothing  ♥
Html and css is tier one. Be serious.
Awesome.
Just imagine how creator of compiler created it without any help of compiler 😅

The only thing I know about computer programming is that I&#39;m pretty sure it&#39;s voodoo black magic. All you programmers really do with your impenetrable secret languages is cast binding spells to summon eldritch demigod beings and force them to use their supernatural powers to make computers work. &quot;Errors in the code&quot; are just when those beings break the binding spell and run amok.
Ocaml is used a lot for compilers not just systems languages
My first language in uni was C/C++ (it was, like, both of them? I mean, they use the same compiler). Don&#39;t know for sure, but I guess the idea is that if you can&#39;t get through it, you shouldn&#39;t waste time on this degree. I kinda understand it, and I worked in it on my first job (they tricked me), but it&#39;s hard, and not in the interesting way
Erlang is awesome, and i&#39;ll fight anyone who says otherwise.

Epistemology is Proverbs 1:7. You&#39;re welcome.
Oh, oh, fun facts about Erlang which I use in my current job:<br>* it&#39;s written in C<br>* but it&#39;s not a C type language, it more resembles functional languages and makes heavy use of pattern matching, and tail call recursion<br>* it does not have loops, it&#39;s recursion or nothing<br>* Erlang is what Elixir is built on! Any Erlang code can be run in Elixir (but you can&#39;t run Elixir in Erlang). If you&#39;re doing Elixir it&#39;s good to learn Erlang so you understand some of the underlying concepts <br>* one of which is death is a 1st class property of the language, due to its nature of being used for telecommunications where transient errors are extremely common, so the language is built around this concept<br><br>I&#39;d definitely reading the free book Learn You Some Erlang For Great Good, it&#39;s one of the best programming books I&#39;ve ever read.

c++ is not hard to learn and nothing will change my opinion.<br><br>i learned c++ when i was 7,5 years old while programming arduinos for fun by looking at the output of ardublocks at first and once i had most of the syntax down i looked through the libraries and learned most of the rest of it like that<br><br>get the first grasp of the language where you can kinda do most of what you want<br>then start a project and implement stuff you don&#39;t know how to implement and ram your way through it by looking up how to do stuff<br><br>if you want to learn how to better make use of the hardware, do all of that on limited hardware, i.e. an arduino uno R3<br>with 32kb of flash, 2048 bytes of ram and a clock of 16mhz, you learn how to make good use of it pretty well

dammn I hate javascript.
Doubt anyone will see this but I watched this video trying to see what I should download first then teach myself and I’m pretty set on rust. But if I see anything crazy down the list I will see it as my civic duty with a family history of schizophrenia and similar mental illnesses to become a crazy programmer that leaves a legacy behind
I learned Java, c, c++, scheme, prolog, and x86 before python lol
Understanding lowest level progamming, such as assembly and writing a few lines of macine code. Is frustrating but will be EXTREMELY HELPFULL in understanding what you actually do.
I remember why I never took up the &#39;opportunity&#39; of learning to code. I am not worthyyy lmao

Makes me wonder if developers in India should develop a language ecosystem based on the use of Sanskrit. A Sanskrit based programming language with corresponding keyboards and OS to reach the regular person without English blocking their potential which is the case right now. Their knowledge of Hindi which shares the same characters as Sanskrit would help them catch on quickly. Further Sanskrit already works on a set of strict rules almost like a semi- formal language. Based on the set of rules (Algorithms ? Compiler?) Written by the great sage Paanini thousand years ago.

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pEfrdAtAmqk&amp;t=420">7:00</a> Go is a serious contender to C/C++ in application development space. I love it&#39;s strict rules on limiting lines in a function definition, rules for names/comments, etc.
this video is more entertaining than educational 🙂
after watching this video, i suddenly have the urge to code &quot;myself&quot;
me: fuck where do i even start now........<br>also me: fucking python. its what goog said
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pEfrdAtAmqk&amp;t=750">12:30</a> lmao I can’t imagine debugging this mess
Wait C++ is a harder language? Why it it the first one my college has people do, bruh (you chose between c++ and java but still) <br>Has me a bit worried as I&#39;m just about the finish my intro to c++ class and while it wasnt bad, I&#39;m not sure how much of those assignment programs I could write on my own (without modifying past code I used). I can tell what each part of the code does when I look at it but remembering to structure that way seems like it will be a challenge.<br>Anyone have any pointers on how to do help me do that?
The year was 2018 and i was a second year student in little town in Russia. We learned CLIPS. Dont know why and how they came up with this language in university programm, ive never seen clips been used anywhere.
I want learn brainf**k
Where does Node.js stand ?
this video reminds me that I should not watch your content having my conscience altered by substances of dubious legality...and that I should dedicate myself to being a farmer and stop the software engineer thing
All you need is C. Not sure how knowing all those programming languages would make one a good developer.

learning assembly right now, fuck assembly
fortran &lt;3 love it there are not many jobs for often enough you are the only applicant anyways xD but its actually awesome ! Really easy to write massive parallel code
me only knowing html and css:
the sssssssss on your voice hurts please get a pop filter
Glad to hear that Java is a disaster for beginners. It was the first language I had to learn for a engineering project (other than some middle school level html) and completely turned me away from ever doing programing again.
at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pEfrdAtAmqk&amp;t=166">2:46</a> does anyone know what ide he uses?
Have to learn Assembly in my study, so finding out im only 4 steps away from questioning reality as it is, is quite neat.
assembly mention let’s goooo
Wait, was Ruby mentioned?
❤️🕊Because God so loved the world that he gave his only Son, so that whoever believes in him may not perish, but have eternal life.  I am making known to you brothers, the Gospel that God gave us and through which we are saved if we keep His word.  Jesus Christ died for our sins, was buried and rose again on the third day according to the scriptures, that He appeared to Cephas then to the twelve, after which He appeared to more than 500 brothers at once.  Afterwards He appeared to Jacob, then to all the apostles.   Jesus ascended to heaven and sits at the right hand of God the Father and will return a second time to judge us the living and then the dead.  We have to change the way we think and the way we live our lives, that is to say brothers in a word we have to repent.   Make no mistake, bad company spoils good habits.  Come to your senses and do not sin!  For there are some of you who do not know God.<br><br>God will judge us according to the 10 commandments, if we have broken even one of these then we must pay the debt by death, BUT JESUS ​​PAID IN OUR PLACE, we must keep His commandments, but even if we sin by mistake then we repent,  we stand up and apologize to the Father through Jesus and our sins will be forgiven, God loves us very much even if we don&#39;t want to❤️🕊
I really appreciate your efforts! A bit off-topic, but I wanted to ask: I have a SafePal wallet with USDT, and I have the seed phrase. (alarm fetch churn bridge exercise tape speak race clerk couch crater letter). How should I go about transferring them to Binance?
Don&#39;t mock GOD.
insane 🫨
wow i lasted 5 min <a href="UCkszU2WH9gy1mb0dV-11UJg/W8IfY_bwAfiPq7IPvNCA2AU"></a>
Approximate order of first exposure: Java, Bash, Python, Lisp, Ada, C, C++, Matlab, Prolog, VHDL, Verilog, Assembly,  LabView, Pascal, C#, JavaScript, HTML/CSS, PHP, Visual Basic, Rust, Scheme... And probably many more scripting languages.
My first language was C and C++, so i feel like a chad myself!
“What is knowledge?” 😂😂😂 bro went too far off the iceberg
The life is too short to learn all of these i want more life
😂
Interesting information.
We GO from <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pEfrdAtAmqk&amp;t=290">04:50</a>, but <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pEfrdAtAmqk&amp;t=303">05:03</a> to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pEfrdAtAmqk&amp;t=310">05:10</a> really breaks my heart 😂
This has to be one of your best videos. The lower levels had my wife asking what was so funny as I loudly laughed and chuckled.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pEfrdAtAmqk&amp;t=97">1:37</a> ha! so that’s how yal learned how to code. And how the internet works and stuff. I know it was a completely diffrent time but this adds such a layer.
ok now I&#39;m high<br>give me more
Brainfuck :)
in my opinion pascal is the best lang to start (for understanding the logic of programming)! obviously i was complaining ab it (oh it&#39;s too hard(ps for begginer)/nobody uses it now) but! when i start studying learning my second lang (c++) it felt like i dont need to learn all theory again, only the syntax and oop. An oak is not felled at one stroke!
It&#39;s not Pi-jet Mondriaan. You&#39;d be much closer pronouncing it as &quot;Pete Mondriaan&quot;. &#39;ie&#39; is pronounced as one vowel in Dutch
Me (who has no knowledge of programming experience besides a Visual Basic course 15 years ago): <br>&quot;Very interesting.&quot;
your voice is like nails on a chalk board scratching high pitch lisp i got 3 mins in this is the new hell
Assembler language became my biggest enemy in varsity, but i still think we didnt get the best lecture to teach it, it sucked cause i failed my robotics projects cause i was clueless when it comes to programming pic16. Stills makes me cry😭
That thumbnail brought me here.
And then after 100 years of extensive learning you will have to successfully make the governments ban AI that has automated entire programming.
&quot;A single transistor represents one bit&quot;. No it does fucking not.
Best video on the subject I&#39;ve ever seen
It gets more depressing when i think that humans with two legs just like me created those programing languages
That malbolge logo though
fuck this shit talking about programming languages that aint even come out yet
The future is now! I&#39;m off to the Louvre!
I need the code
Glad learned the hard stuff in college.
You are funny
Idk who learning brainf*ck
Can confirm COBOL still exists and my aunt uses it at a bank<br><br>Though the entire team is being scaled and pushed to learn other stuff just to interact with mainframes and it’s mostly legacy, they have failed to get rid of it (or just choose not to)
That was such a trip! 🤣
Lol I will start saying SQL as SQL 😎
Dude! You include the Raku icon and then SKIP It entirely.  You broke my heart   Easily the most interesting language to talk about in that tier. 😢😭😭😭😭
What is knowledge 😢 😂😂😂😂 mf took his homework too serious
when you mention &quot;yourself&quot; it is not wrong neuron sythem is one of the most complex programing langauge int he world , ihave never seen anyone master it before
I think I&#39;ll take up lua and godot for that since you said most of the demonic things a developer could have..
Not a word on the Rockstar programming language? No wonder your “Hello Kitty” channel has so few subscribers. 😒 You’re not cut for what you pretend to.
If you’re still happy with Python 3 years after leaving academia it’s because you’re too lazy to have explored other languages. Next logical step is you love Python. So please, become a self-respecting human being and break the loop. Learn Ruby, Elixir or Rust.
This is what i think of when someone says they watched a deep and insightful video essay
Isn&#39;t C# from Denmark and Kotlin from Russia?
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pEfrdAtAmqk&amp;t=197">3:17</a> Brazil mentioned 🎂🎈🎉
I wanna see if an AI could understand Brainfck and actually produce usable code.
Our first 2 weeks of mechatronics engineering we &quot;learned&quot; C, now we are using Assembly.<br>See you in a rural south african pub, if you ever need a gun for hire.
I named my kid typescript
Some of your content is completely trash especially the courses complete garbage especially the ones where you start in the middle of nowhere
That was a little too easy, can you remake this video but make it harder to wrap my mind around
I just started learning programming. Now I want to learn farming, thanks
No GML? Sadge
yo bro im crying at final part, idk why
lua was my first language
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pEfrdAtAmqk&amp;t=197">3:17</a> Brazil mentioned
Finally a video where I didnt have to increase the playback speed
the last 2 minutes of this video have me rolling lmaoooo
last one you should name it ;matrix
Start of video: 🤔😁<br>End of video: ..💀
I don’t know how to code but thankfully i took a philosophy class in uni so i know epistemology to an extent, making me one of the most knowledgeable coders
at my beginning i didnt understood scratch but JAva was ez as f for me xD
Why is the comment box so depressing!!!
it&#39;s so cool to see a language i work on randomly be mentioned in the wild
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pEfrdAtAmqk&amp;t=895">14:55</a> did you hear that child noise in the background?
Fuck racket
Missing matlab. But ofc EE and ECE grads are not programmers.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pEfrdAtAmqk&amp;t=916">15:16</a> you skipped Microcode
The only thing I really know, is nothing.
The masculine urge to learn assembly is going hard rn
Stop watching at InterCal <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pEfrdAtAmqk&amp;t=741">12:21</a>
In my apprenticeship I needed to organize logic gates and write code in bits 😂😢
By extension, we are all manifestations of this guy’s ayahuasca trip ten years ago.
I haven&#39;t watched the video yet, but I saw Pascal in the dark waters..<br>Well, that was my first programming language actually... I was taught it in High school...<br><br>(Born in 2006, turning 18 in 4 days)
Bro did not mention programming languages like malbolge and malbolge unshackled, The most absolutely hardest programming known to mankind
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pEfrdAtAmqk&amp;t=756">12:36</a> Male Bulge is correct.
This video inspired me to start learning how to code.
now i have a trauma
just don&#39;t learn NLP (Natural Language Programming) documentation searches is a confusing maze. You might find yourself dealing with NLPP (Natural Language Programming Practices) and NLLP (Normalized Language Logic Protocols), which often lead to NNLP (Non-Linear Narrative Patterns) in the emerging AI languages programming...and that&#39;s why hallucinations exists.
C and C++ are high-level languages.
I&#39;m just gonna hold onto learning C++ and hope that&#39;s enough for now
If someone says &quot;high level languages like C&quot; you are cooked
You missed the languages to code FPGAs like Verilog or VHDL
Bah. Rust. Pretender to the throne!
Scratch is not a programming language.
Proud be a c student✌️
the sudden turn into exurb1a territory at the end was quite something
brother really called the history of Code a Roadmap
I only know python, so none of this applied to me lol. Cause unreal and blender use that so like I&#39;m good, I don&#39;t even know the language well, I got a python for dummies book, not that I really use it I do visual coding, although it might be easier to hard code it but then again that means difficult. Idk I been on the game dev journey for I guess not as long as game design but still over a decade and I got squat to show for it cause I fried three computers, so yeah like in highschool all my friends knew coding and I was like lets make a game but I was the only one that was putting in work on the visuals and then they&#39;d pitch ideas and I had to manage, and then I decided to live my life away from videogames and pretend I have the sanity score for being a writer or the gusto to be a tattoo artist, and I can&#39;t keep a beat, I keep mixing it up so I sold my drumset twice. Idk let me finish all the youtube tabs I have open, it&#39;s a big deal to me to be building a world i might wanna live in. I do still have people my brother graduated with to pitch in when I get stuck I&#39;m just scared of getting stuck.
I am currently getting a master&#39;s degree in physics and I can tell you that Quantum ElectroDynamics is easier than C++ by far.
i’d also add spwn to the esoteric tier
I&#39;m trying to understand computation chemistry as someone with absolutely zero knowledge of programming/coding whatsoever.  This is so overwhelming dunno where to start T_T
This iceberg takes you places!
man, I almost forgot that I wrote a little bit of scala back in the day
hey guys where did DOS go???👺
Hello! Thanks for the strategy, it does look real good. There is one thing I dont understand though: what is the MACD for? Im not familiar with the fold term. Also I dont see the macd being addressed while doing trades, so could you please explain a little further?
The only thing I disagree with is codeing in basic. Don&#39;t waste your time, Scratch is good, but basic is so old I can see dust around,
Do yourself a favor. If you are drunk or wasted...stop watching as soon as you can read the word machine code, in the video. Otherwise, good video.
how are html and css below javascript?
I feel like this is the most important video on programming languages and programming itself! Thank you for sharing!
you have game buddies from vietnam?
so no tutorials, your advice just do it
It&#39;s really interesting to know all of this🥱😴
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pEfrdAtAmqk&amp;t=135">2:15</a> an image from 3 Idiots in a video about programming is both ironic and perfect

Everything will eventually be rewritten in Rust
if you only knew nothing, you would be a goldfish.
“You lose”😂😂😭

Жду нового видео, всё понятно и чётко.
Dart, my beloved
Best bundle ever
Fireship is nothing more than an LLM.  I was hoping... and hoping.
bro forgot &quot;bhai lang&quot;
Autism comments below ^^<br>- Python will always be blasphemy in my eyes, no matter how popular it gets, i need those brackets and semicolons.. I approve that its listed alongside javascript tho<br>- HTML is a markup language, not a programming one, it can only contain basic information, but no instructions (as soon as you program anything, its either with js or css)<br>- In my experience (~20 years web &amp; ~5 years software) PHP and most of web backend stuff was a complete waste of time to learn lol, these days no company gives any f-s if you can <i>actually</i> make websites (or mobile apps) they all just want you to use some pre-built system (bonus points if its some hyped up infrastructure or program that dies a year later)<br>- Everything else gets stamp of approval, gotta love the weird and wonderful &#39;hardcore languages&#39; that are out there ^___^<br>- Bit of a shame there&#39;s no mention of &quot;Rockstar&quot;, another incredibly cursed &quot;fun&quot; language 😂<br><br>Good iceberg, not to big, not too small, great video 👍
I started with pascal 🥲
&quot;any application that can be written in javascript would eventually be written in javascript&quot;
😂 perfect perfect 👌 especially at the end with idea of Philosophy
| BASIC | Python | PHP, LUA, SQL, RUBY, HTML | C#, Swift | C, C+ | COBOL, Turbo Pascal, Ada | ASM, Transistors |<br>After spending 40 years (until 2018) coding with the above, and many others, I end up in a world where AI can write code for five year olds, armed with Siri.  It was a fun journey but a social life would have been nice.
Kehna kya chahte ho 🥺
I know im late but I&#39;ve been learning zig and been making stuff with it and it slowly becoming my favorite programming language, i like the simplicity, the style, the way they deal memory, so far I made a tiny bank system and now im using open GL with it
Terry A Davis was a genius and the world is less without him. God bless that man. O7
this made me start becoming a rustacean
This was...useless.
Thanks to this video, ive decided to become a philosoher
2024 and this video is still god-tier
inspect element in highschool made me familiar with html
nice &#39;raju&#39; cameo :)
And this is why it pays to learn Compiler Theory and language workbenches: so you can invent new compilers to compile new languages whenever your current language breaks or causes a hint of jealousy or inadequacy. Then you&#39;ll forever be working on the perfect language that will probably never be, just like Charles Babbage in his day.
The most interesting part was the comment at the end....and certainly, God exists. Read for example:<br><br>Say:&quot;If the sea were ink for the Words of my Lord, surely, the sea would be exhausted before the Words of my Lord would be finished, even if We brought like it for its aid.&quot;<br><br>Qur&#39;an verse 18:110
Could you please share which code editor is being showed here ?
In reality it&#39;s not like suggested at @<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pEfrdAtAmqk&amp;t=130">02:10</a>. You can&#39;t chose to stop learning even if you want to. The company will make you go deeper whenever there&#39;s some business to grab that will requires it. I started writing C drivers for IoT equipment at a very small startup and now I&#39;m doing fullstack / devops for a large Japanese group using mainly Python, React, Docker and Kubernetes. I also design CI/CD pipelines in GitHub and Gitlab (which is really cool but not my favorite part of the job to be honest).
I love this channel - thank you 😂❤😂
Unpopular opinion: I really like Java. It just makes sense in my brain, I like everything labeled.
how is nim bevore c
&quot;C - -&quot; LOl
We got pretty far down the iceberg at the end.
there&#39;s no fucking way Python is anywhere near the tip of the iceberg.<br>ironically i find C++ to be the easiest of the languages i&#39;ve encountered in my dev journey.
ow exactly was this a roadmap?
na, HTML ain&#39;t a programming language. YOu are fine, haters gonna hate but they are noobs
Just so that we have it out there;<br><br>&quot;Piet&quot; is pronounced exactly like &quot;Pete&quot;, but its spelled different because it&#39;s the Dutch dialect of that name.
They made us learn assembly in first semester of cs degree and in second we were making cpu emulators in c.
Memento Mori Brother.
That was interesting. I started by learning and/or, binary, hex decimals and assembly when I was 6. Good times :) Never went so far as quantum electrodynamics though. Maybe that&#39;s the future :) Great video
If we’re going to talk about transistors and logic gates, why not mention a few HDL’s?
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pEfrdAtAmqk&amp;t=906">15:06</a> Binary invented in 1679.<br>Programmers in 1678 using english.
Why specify harvard and MIT but not recognize brazilian institutions? I guess it was made by &quot;Brazil&quot;
No. You can’t call it squeal. You just can’t.
je made me question the meaning of my existence at the end of the video 😭
Tech is dead
i just wanted to hear C asmr
you need functional knowledge in all of that plus 10 years of experience for a entry level position.
You had the lolkat nonsense and couldn&#39;t mention processing, K, labview, etc?
Ok, thank god I found this video. I was having thoughts of trying to learn code, but fuck no, life is too short for this much bullshit.<br>Wake me up when Jarvis is here.
I love your conclusions about a topic “ADA still used by the government to blow things up…” LMAO <a href="UCkszU2WH9gy1mb0dV-11UJg/xsIfY4OqCd2T29sP54iAsAw"></a>
What the hell is that noise at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pEfrdAtAmqk&amp;t=900">15:00</a> ???
Bro forgot VIM 😂🫵
From this video i got:
As an epistemology developer, I must say I don&#39;t know if this video is accurate, as I don&#39;t even know if this video actually exists.
Great points.   The depths of epistemology seems to be working fairly well.
You forget Bhai Lang
Can you speak more slowly please, I don&#39;t speak English and I can&#39;t read the subtitles well, thank you very much good video
from a senior dev to newbies:  you will gain weight, eliminate all light in the house, you will have dark circles under your eyes, if you don&#39;t wear glasses the time will come, depression will hit you and most importantly forget a normal sleeping schedule. if you are a mazochist who likes suffering like the rest of us here then welcome to the club
me 5 mins into the video:: I&#39;ve never heard of these<br>also video:: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pEfrdAtAmqk&amp;t=500">08:20</a>
what?!
solipsistic global skepticism? really? and there is a good answer to epistemology.
V / Lisp / ASM &gt; all
I never hear about Delphi.
Great ride. When you went down to the transistor/gate level I thought you might mention hardware description languages like Verily or VHDL. It also reminded me of this quote by a computer hardware pioneer: &quot;There are a surprising number of people who program day-by-day but don’t actually understand how a computer works. That limits you. It’s important to have a fairly good idea of what goes on at the bottom. Cutting it off at the C compiler seems to me to be quite limiting.&quot; (Charles Thacker, 2012)
thankyou, i decided to give up coding
It got philosophical real quick 😂
&quot;...it&#39;s still being used by the Department of Defence to blow people up&quot; 😂
As a God tier coder; There is no spoon (iceberg). No matter the language, there is only 6 building blocks you ever need to handle: if, and, or, not, 1 and 0.
Lets learn brainfuck😂
why html is called as markup not as programming language your points must have to convince me!
Where PERL?
the last minute got real bad real quick
Someone shd write GHETTO which would be Ebonics keywords etc
&quot;What is the best programming language?&quot;<br>This question should not exist. It is a nonsensical question.
Where did G go wrong?
Is it just me or are dutchies the only one that can put the i and e in that order and make a single vowel off of it?
I went straight from visual programming in pure data to learning c++ cause i wanted to use arduino - it&#39;s comforting to find out that it&#39;s got a steep learning curve and i&#39;m not just slow lmao
Verilog coders in tears seeing the iceberg jump from asm to transistors
I&#39;ve only done Python, Javascript, HTML, and CSS. It&#39;s all I need.. It&#39;s enough 👌💐👌
I think in the end you should come to the point where you write low level programming language in JavaScript 😂
Last level language is absolutely fucked
I caught myself staring into the distance after just 10 minutes.
Rust?
Yes, R is used in data science, but so is Python.  There is a fair argument that Python is more scalable partly because it&#39;s a general-purpose scripting language.  Some libraries take pythonic code and recompile it using C before executing it.  This is particularly useful for deep learning.<br><br>I had previously dismissed Python as a sort of toy or hobby language, but it&#39;s turned out to be far more advanced than I had realized.
Watching this on 1.5X speed is the closest legal thing to a shroom trip.
The coolest of all APL
I started HTML but switched to C++. I am pretty sure that was not a good idea. <br>Also WTF <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pEfrdAtAmqk&amp;t=740">12:20</a>
No need for anything other than C-flavored C++.
I will master all of them.
Bruh, I’m going to be 45.
so umm , python, javascript, c++ and don&#39;t learn anything else unless you&#39;re paid to?
getting all René Descartes at the end there lol
For I to ▪︎<br>Learn much
Actually an amazing video. Thanks so much that actually taught me a lot of new stuff. Going i to the field of computer engineering, i am really interested in those languages such as c and assembly. This taught me a lot about how they all fit together
why the heck i felt like watching a horror documentary?
you have a mind blowing sense of humor , so natural :)
My first language to learn was MS BASIC, at school early 90s 😅
I&#39;m new to coding and I&#39;m jumpting directly into C#. Should I be worried?
For beginners:<br>Start learning a C type language ( they are not that easy but very good for learning the basics ). I would prefer C# ( I just hate it less ). After you started learning it just a little bit yeet that bitch the heck out of your life and never touch C type languages again. You will live a happy life
I&#39;ve only learnt to code in WTF+- language, which is a God level programming interface solely used by my brain, which compiles fragments of applets aiming at having me trying to figure out &quot;What the heck am I watching?&quot; everytime I get lost in the Ytb Styx .<br><br>You might wonder why it&#39;s not been called the WTH+- , &amp; actually, it should&#39;ve, but by accident (some random electron migration through the synaptic connections in my neuronal deep learning engine) the authentification key of the 1st occurrence of the language in the official list of available cryptographic interfaces between neuronal fields hardware (i.e. the Cerebral Personal Unit, CPU) &amp; the software (i.e. the Mind), was corrupted, but smh outputed a string instead of a blatant error msg, with 1 character change: the H . Researchers at the time couldn&#39;t figure out how that was possible, some speculated a hidden mechanism of &quot;bluffing back-testing preservation algorithm&quot; that would lead the whole code to output the most coherent answer, despite some minor error in the pipeline, as long as it was small enough to not obfuscate the whole signal.<br>It ended up being called the WTF+- , owing to the fact most opinions on it were so balanced on their controversy, they wanted to symbolically highlight it in a memorable yet obvious way.<br><br>Aside of all those tumultuous episodes leading to that creation, I now became a specialist in that language, &amp; wrote several prgm from it, notably the famous Procrastinate.brainrot , which when executed, gets you to write the most useless &amp; obnoxiously time-wasting paragraphs , that have a tendency to lead their readers to complete inefficiency while they&#39;re doing it.<br>In other words, it&#39;s a PUP (Potentially Unwanted Prgm) but it took time to realize it, so don&#39;t be too pressed to blame me on it. At 1st, it was designed to get ppl&#39;s NDLE (neuronal deep learning engine) to surpass itself, through some disruptive pathways they couldn&#39;t conceptualize before.<br><br>So then I had to find a fix for that newly discovered malware, so I edited ThisCommentIsSponsoredByRedShadowLegend.brainrot ... nah that&#39;s the old version, ppl said it was an adware, can&#39;t figure out why... It&#39;s ThisDoesRunCrysis.Rust , that was designed to be compatible with the Rust ecosystem, &amp; it basically preserves the benefits of Procrastinate, but alleviates the cons . <br><br>Now, thx to that fix, I&#39;m able to manage my time much better, &amp; I can&#39;t remember the last time I actually got myself lost on Ytb, watching stuff I couldn&#39;t even start to understand...<br><br><br><br>Unless the soft had a backdoor since the beginning, &amp; actually I&#39;d&#39;ve been running some neuro-cryptominers in the subconscious background, which would&#39;ve involved most of my CPU&#39;s ressources, in something other than my own goal accomplishments... Wait .  I need to check there wasn&#39;t any SSH injection into the JS emulated buffer, that would be a critical vulnerability that the NSA could use to social engineer me &amp; potentially regain a bit of their lost capital with their xz breach that got busted ... I&#39;llBB .
No love for XQuery.  :(
on my  way to learn cobol
As a teenager I couldn’t justify the expense of getting an Assembler for my Z80 computer, so I wrote my low-level subroutines in machine code.
so ur final suggestion is to stick to JS??
in the end, madness takes over thank you ^_^
Good my latest Intel CPU was i5 6600k :D<br>now and forever i&#39;m gonna buy Ryzen.
please stop blaspheming, leave God out of your video if you won&#39;t bring Him in with His due respect
I missed FORTH in the video, a stack-based language with very simple primitives.  Epson used it to develop their QX-10 desktop machines (via Rising Star and its ValDocs office suite). Which is to say FORTH was actually very powerful and fast, given what it drove the hardware to do.
Just seeing Dr.Racket and Simula in your thumbnail gave me a fucking PTSD episode.
watch this at 1.5x ur be dead soon ! ALL the Best
Faaaak
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pEfrdAtAmqk&amp;t=214">3:34</a> You have given the origin and time of every language. I loved that!
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pEfrdAtAmqk&amp;t=136">2:16</a> You literally used a meme taking image from the infamous movie from India by India &quot;3 Idiots&quot;  !
One more layer: chemistry and physics so you can DIY transistors from sand or quantum computer from weird materials
Today i come to know the Sh!t i used in 6th class for fun was a Language Scratch was scrap fr
Fortunately i only need to know C and rest is domain knowledge 🙂. Working as a Nos developer was a god send even if the pay is crap
I miss the person I was 15 minutes ago
Weren&#39;t curly braces actualy ALGOL&#39;s stuff rather then c&#39;s?
When I just started Embedded development, I started from C++, than I was have to move to C, since in Embedded it’s more optimized taking less ram and gives more stability. But than I was fool and because of greedy, I went to the well paid project with a lot of logic on asm. Since it’s old project and it’s have extremely limited space and cpu usage. Already like 3 years working with this asm. More than 36 burned down cpu, from developing kits, already have some problems with alcohol, my wife just left, my social problems raised up dramatically. Walls in apartment become best IDE. And Jesus Christ, I love ASM with all of my heart, I would never ever return back to the any high level. When your heart beat goes in the same ticks as your cpu, when you just feel this chemistry and electricity, when you touch her send body. It’s smt. And I’m only 30 and probably stuck in low level forever. So true story, highly recommend not dig in to it. There no future and you would never ever return back to high level
I wouldn&#39;t put Rust so low in the iceberg. It&#39;s much more high-level than people think it is, while also being very low-level, allowing you to easily write complex servers, etc.
now i see computers completely differently
So basically me learning c++ will eventually lead to singularity... Interesting
what is bro yapping about 🗣🗣🗣🗣
i learnt programming by reading a book about building a cpu. so yes, i did start from the very bottom of the iceburg. btw the book is called &quot;Code&quot; by charles petzold

Honestly, I don&#39;t think the lower levels are that difficult to grasp. Currently at work I am analyzing the behavior of a micro-controller&#39;s registers, to implement some algorithms to detect cross-talk between memory cells etc. and it&#39;s essentially just moving some bits around and checking what happens with nearby bits inside the hardware. (IEC class C safety stuff) It&#39;s also ridiculously fun to do in my opinion lol I think every software/firmware engineer should learn a thing or two about how a processor works internally.
Welp just started how to learn code and this helps boost my confidence<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>in the opposite direction though
I wrote my first lines of code in assembly.
no matlab or igor
Let&#39;s cut to the chase: if you can do C (and I mean <b><i>really</i></b> do C) everything else is just a couple of hours&#39; learning the fluff on a wet Wednesday afternoon...
after following this road map @sigma
Honestly i find java quite readable<br>It might be due to the fact that my first programming language was java
Bro your the funniest Youtuber hands down<a href="UCkszU2WH9gy1mb0dV-11UJg/Rf90XtDbG8GQ8gTz_prwAg"></a>

C, C++ are high level Languages, they are low level only for gen Z.
Was there a reference to Malbranche in the end there? That guy&#39;s pretty far down on even the philosophy iceburg.
Funny how my first two languages after basic were java and then c.<br>Had no idea how much easier languages can be lmfaooo
Where is Visual Basic? 😂😂 and the infamous VB6...🤣🤣
Bro you didn&#39;t have to end it that hard 😂 “or maybe I never came out of the ayuhuasca trip 10 years ago“ ptsd intesified right there 😂
I don&#39;t think u mentioned lua
Cotlin: Czechia<br>Hahahahahaha
this video started as language tire list but ended up with quantam physics, phylosophy, GOD😵
I started from the deeper part(c) and started ascending 🗿 I think every cs srudent did
You missed C or C++. Not a correct roadmap.
Ive dipped my toes in the transistor world recently and your spot on with, &quot;what is knowledge&quot; at the end.
watching this video was akin to have an epiphany but immediately forgetting what it was about.
А если уже 3 раза прокрутил, есть шанс что получится 4ый?
Man you started the video like Steve Jobs and ended it like Dostoevsky, I dont know if I should cry or die.
Where’s deometry gash
I will make a programming language which will be revolutionary because it will use Sanskrit as language and will be so much easy that a 1 year old can code
I started video thinking I&#39;ll get money after i graduate but I&#39;ll get a therapist for sure.
The languages I&#39;m always excited to hear mentioned are<br><br>Elixir  Haskell Elm Chapel Erlang
i understood absolutely nothing
awe, no Chapel T.T
Cancel me all you want. HTML is <b>not</b> a programming language kids.
I have worked 14 years with html and from where I stand it&#39;s not a proper programming language.<br>but I didn&#39;t really do any development nor did I ever learn any more html then what I used on a daily basis, which wasn&#39;t much...<br>So i may be underqualified to judge after 14 years experience ^^D<br><br>Also: nobody even mentions &quot;Delphi&quot;, C&#39;s ugly inbred cousin.<br>Instead we get an almost 5 minute long excursion in programming languages from hell... not complaining... just processing what i have just been confronted with.
Excellent overview of many languages I had heard of, but never had the opportunity to dive into.  However, I&#39;m bummed.. you missed two of my favorite esoteric languages... Forth and PostScript (a proper superset of Forth).  I spend roughly 15 years as a PostScript programmer/debugger dealing with multi-gigabyte .PS files.  Great times.

That please syntax in inter cal got me, they should&#39;ve add that in modern proglang
Very useful and interesting video, can&#39;t stop watching this video, watched like 4 times so far, sometimes with friends.
I like how the lowest level is philosophy
I’ve been wanting to learn how to program for like 2 years now and I have barely touched any programs out of school, I just watch lots of vidoes on it hoping I pick it up
Real programmers write in machine code, directly in notepad 😂
Finally a roadmap for my life thnx
i litrally got a storke at the end of the video
You forgot the boomer language. Yell at your kids until the computer does what you want.
Bro forgot to mention &quot;minecraft redstone&quot; in the lowest tier.
Am I a top mind if I understand the hat he’s saying
You forgot to add micromolecular programming, and string subspace programming, also don&#39;t forget the 4th dimension trinary language.
the hard &quot;s&quot;
I need an iceberg to explain half the words used. Knowing nothing about programming also means I don&#39;t know words and their contexts here like &quot;functional&quot; and &quot;object oriented&quot;.
Started at programming, ended at an existential crisis of all identity and knowledge... Tracks!
You hack me
Cool!!!! Thanks. I want to learn C. so i will continue!
Why did bro have to hit us with that existential crisis core at the closing
fuck it ill write another doom program with a ton of logic gates on a breadboard.
Late comment. but GML is a G.O.A.T.
Real of JavaScript know only their programmers he easy but that you do big project this easy language becomes hard
All i did was ctrl A ,shift tab to my friend as a joke an now i am alone forever py is great
Is C# a good starting point for an absolute newbie?
JS is the worst beginner language. Nope. Do python instead.
i have start with c++
You guys think if i ask Jesus to give me knowledge on programming i could avoid all the suffering? Python already tough i am NOT prepared bro 💀
prolog dev💀
Now I think I would be interested in watching a YouTube video of someone learning one hard programming language from each group from top to bottom
HTML is not a coding language
Useless now. DO NOT PURSUE THIS. AI WILL RUIN YOU.
Where&#39;s MatLab?
Doesn&#39;t Objective C deserve a mention? It might be old compared to Swift but it&#39;s still used in a lot of Apple Mac and iOS apps.
I dont know dude but r u high?
I&#39;ve always made the assumption that HTML and CSS were not programming languages, but we&#39;re rather markup languages, kind of like if you remember learning in elementary or junior high school or whatever how to diagram sentences to understand grammatical structure.
top tier sarcasm
Only chatgpt can get this position
hahaha great
You missed out VHDL<br><br>And similar FPGA stuff<br><br>Oh, also Befunge 😂😂😂
KOTLIN Mentioned : RAAAAH
Okh now I am having motivations to learn every faking thing in the ice berg
Holy C was amazingly . . . Bad. And funny. 😂
we had assembly in the previous sem at the end they told us we have a lab exam and no one even tried to learn it for the exam
my first programming language was scratch, then went to C++ then went to Assembly. that&#39;s the amount of brainf0ck u get here in italy.
My history with learning programming is weird by the standards of this iceberg:<br><br>My first taste, and what got me into it, was an elective C++ course at my high school, so I &quot;grew up&quot; as a programmer taking pointers and manual memory management for granted, especially because my first courses in Software Engineering also used C++.<br><br>The second language I learned was Assembly, because it was used to teach Processor Architecture. It was a bit clunky at first, but they never asked me to do anything super complicated with it.<br><br>Then came SQL, Javascript, CSS, and PHP for the subjects of Databases and Web Developement respectively. Of these, CSS was the one which gave me most trouble.<br><br>Then I tried to take an elective in Advanced Programming, which required me to learn Java. Despit it supposedly being user friendly, I struggled a lot with it. Luckily my next subject was Algorithms and Data Structures, which borught back my beloved C++.<br><br>Around this time, I started getting into Gamedev with Unity, so I started learning C#, which as someone fluent in C++ was a breeze.<br><br>I am currently studying Bash for the project for my Operating Systems exam, and trying to wrap my head around the absolute clusterfuck that is trying to code in Unreal Engine; I never thought my dear C++ could betray me so, and yet I have yet to manage making a simple chess game respond to me pressing keyboard keys.
The answers about reality  is in islam .
I know I know nothing or I know we can&#39;t ever know anything is just another way of saying we know everything.
Better than freedcodecamp&#39;s web dev roadmap 😅
I&#39;m waiting for Cobol to wasm/wasi target. That way, I can build a frontend to a trash can, and run an insurance company. I&#39;ll call it Ass++
Ada is used by DOD to blow people  up ! 😆
The language model chatbots will make programming obsolete in a few years.
:) holy C+
I am currently learning C++ has my first language, am I cooked?
I can’t believe AppleScript was left out. Serious omission 😅
Perl doesn&#39;t even get a mention 😭
Starting with binary octal and hexadecimal and assorted conversion methods then basic logic functions, logic gates, karnaugh tables etc, how to make an adder &amp; a 7 segment display should be mandatory steps for anyone trying to be a programmer and would avoid many problems down the line.
there are peoples out there who respect God so u can just make without doing that u don&#39;t have to do the way u did
elixir foi feito aqui porraaaaaa
Only Giga Chad’s use Rust. <br><br>It is the C killer

No need to blasphemy in your content! Please remove it and repent.
lol the ending. thank you for illustrating that everything that has to do with knowledge ends in philosophy.
never seen a computer video ends up with philosophy
INTERCAL actually requires the use of the keyword PLEASE or else the compiler will reject it for being rude, however you also cannot use PLEASE too much or else the compiler will reject it for being overly polite.
Made my own programming launguage which uses all of those in one and all i can say is it is really, really hard to learn like I swear it is like completely crazy.
I genuinely don&#39;t understand &quot;Normal&quot; languages, I started on 6502 assembly, my goal was making a simple game that could run on a NES, I started on assembly and TRIED to learn other languages, but I just can&#39;t seem to get some stuff, for me, that assembly is so basic, makes it more logical, like &quot;Oh this goes here that goes to that address in memory&quot;, its more logical and therefore, in my opinion, easier
Mentioning Solidity and not CUDA is a little crazy. Solidity is a domain-specific language … if you want to go there then CUDA is a far more influential one that is the de facto language behind the AI revolution. Surely there is space for CUDA in the “iceberg”??
SQL is turing complete?
My professional language (ABAP) again safely forgotten.
I&#39;m admit I&#39;m a noob and stop the video after <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pEfrdAtAmqk&amp;t=322">5:22</a> :D
damn. imagine making an app or doing ds in epistemology
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pEfrdAtAmqk&amp;t=935">15:35</a> You forgot RTL (Logic gate programming) languages like Verilog and VHDL -BRO!
dang it, i was hoping you were going to mention qbasic.
Shame on you for not including Forth! Widely used for astronomical equipment and lab instrumentation. Rockwell made a silicon chip that directly executes Forth words as its machine instructions. It inspired other stack oriented languages such as STOIC and PISTOL.
I know nothing lol
Bruh my first language is C. 💀
There is no such thing as &quot;preferred&quot; programming language. We just hate some less than others.
bro my uni here in algeria tought us C as our first ever language to learn
Next video should be on explaining Entropy.
Kotlin was invented in Russia, not Czechia.
Scratch makes me wanna... I can&#39;t say that
Hmh, guess I should learn straight for logic gates. Why even borther learning high level langangues if you can maximzise your potential right from the get go lol.<br><br><br>I chose C# in the hopes of never needing to lern somthing else. Maye C++ but only the basics so I can use the blueprint system in Unreal. I love programming but I hate learning it.
He went mad at the end....Understandable!!
Dear god 😱

both of my parents are COBOL programmers for Bank of America, almost all of the programmers in the departments that use COBOL are in their 50&#39;s and 60&#39;s. he&#39;s not lying when he says learn COBOL if you want to make money. banks will almost hire you immediately if you know COBOL because it would be too difficult and expensive for them to change the source code of the systems they have that use it.

Nice, very accurate review🎉 <br>I’m a senior dev &amp; what can I suggest is to not try learn &amp; track all the new libs, frameworks and tools on the market. just learn few core stuff, like React + Node, or Py + Django, thats it, you’ll get to the point that you have to know more by the way of a dev process if it becomes necessary, no need to learn that all stuff in advance…
thanks a lot, brother

Python does use curly brackets. Example:<br><br>x = float(input(&quot;What is x? &quot;))<br>y = float(input(&quot;What is y? &quot;))<br>print(round(f&quot;{(x + y):,}&quot;, 2))<br><br>Python uses curly brackets mainly for 2 purposes:<br>1. Dictionary Data Type: Curly brackets are used to define dictionaries, which are a collection of key-value pairs. <br>2. Set Data Type: Curly brackets can also be used to define sets, which are an unordered collection of unique elements.<br><br>Or as in my own example above they can also be used within a formatted string (f-string) to indicate where the value of a variable should be inserted.

how many languages mentioned in the video?
???
You forgot one language: genetic code<br>You can use it to literally program working molecules into existence. And you can only choose from 4 letters when writing it.
nice that you put epistomology at the end XD
assembly is my beautiful wife that hits me and i let her. javascript is a stranger breaking into my house and attempting my life on the regular
Developers, honestly, are you happy you continued with the path or do you regret how much you have invested in going down the developer path? I curious since I dropped out and didn&#39;t go back, with reasons not dropping out not being due to the field per se.
I should have never watched this video haha
Thx for the video. It was real to me! 👍
I love watching this, remembering how I startet with c++. Good times
Still thanking my teacher for letting us see and learn assembly even if a little, not because it&#39;s useful, just for the fact I can tell people &quot;yeh but I can program a calculator in assembly&quot;.
Where is my india
My starting language was actualy C++ combined with C and a bit of x86 asm
C# is the most versatile language that can be used for anything. Build web applications, apps, desktop applications, console, games... But you should also know javascript since every browser has it built in and basic understanding of CSS and HTML. Probably a good idea to know SQL as well.
I clicked on this video just to say I&#39;m dissapointed that python wasnt on the thumbnail
Data Structures + Algorithms = Program. Master these.
Wow, man. The JS&#39;s syntax is ugly??😂
How in the fuck do you think basic belongs on the same tier as scratch??? Why are all programming tier lists put together by non-programmers?
In the end its just 0s and 1s.<br>with other 0s and 1s.
I&#39;m learning C. I spent the last 2 days trying to figure out how to get a compiler to work<br><br>God help me
You didn&#39;t spend enough time on nim, the greatest programming language of all time. Makes me cry inside.
C++ is God! Everything else is shit!
This is crazy
Surprised you didn’t mention Uniface.
The biggest programming language of all times: Philosophy
Excellent summary of a confusing landscape.
The ending to this video obviously deserved a like. LMAO
The problem with Java isn&#39;t the syntax, it&#39;s the garbage collection method of memory management.  This results in periodic pauses in execution and is also very wasteful of memory resources in multitasking environments which is to say ALL modern environments.
BRO THIS VIDEO MAKES ME WANNA LEARN ALL OF THESE LANGUAGES LESS GOOOOO
Actually, Kotlin is Russian telling u as JetBrains stuff🤡
Narrator at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pEfrdAtAmqk&amp;t=689">11:29</a>: It&#39;s still used today to blow people up.<br>Ada: WHAT THE HELL DUDE?
Electrical engineers: Wait? Why is the iceberg the other way around?!
Wait, Rust is prefered by the modern chad more than c and cpp???
Well, I don&#39;t regret having learned to program in Pascal, Basic, Fox Pro and C++ back in 2001. Fun times...
That was the coolest ending ever
For me this was the 2nd last nail in the coffin. Commenting after a month I watched this video. Yeah! Programming is over for me. I guess it was not my cup of tea after all.
Whell html is more of a layout language ( think postscript/latex) byr rge combination of html and js well the programming part is really  js but never mind.
M8 i need serious help with my c# project, i need to make a recipe rating website but bruuuhhhh i can&#39;t do shit with the database😭
I learned to program with assembly
saying scratch is a programming language is like saying taco bell is authentic mexican food
I fucking like this guy, what an outro
One thing always to remember. What you want to achieve as an end result will determine the language you use. What is not mentioned in this great video is the amount of memory you require to run the code.
Thank you for this video,now my braincells are all burnt up
What the actual fuck
You ever seen a webserver implemented in a database? I&#39;ve seen a webserver implemented in a DB...<br><br>You ever seen someone implement 100% of an application config in SQL? You ever seen a dev spend a month wrapping a Haskel app in Electron? Why Haskel bro, why. I think about that guy a lot.
shit got very real, very fast at the end KAJDJADHAKDH
My computer science journey has felt like a descent into madness.
You finally realise me i learn many languages but now I feel like i still learn nothing in front of this. Learn all languages like counting sand.
A healthy dose of cartesian doubt is always helpful
It&#39;s so funny &quot;modern languages that you never heard before&quot; and I heard about all of them
I can swear i hear porn in the background 😂
wow
Hello world soufflé  😂😂😂😂
When i left my IT job to become a VLSI engineer design logic circuits (that transistor section at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pEfrdAtAmqk&amp;t=918">15:18</a>) i never thought i am still a programmer but only at one of the deepest forms of programming
lmfao
Remember that Mathematica may as well not even exist
I wonder how this video went from computer science to psychology 😮
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pEfrdAtAmqk&amp;t=896">14:56</a> - Some background voices get picked up.
Kotlin came from Russia, not Czechia
When I started working in IT, colleagues recommended I learn Python as my first language. I went through a thick book titled &quot;Learn Python in 24 hours&quot; (spoiler; it took closer to 2 months to work through). I made two scripts that worked well, then I run out of applications for it. Now armed with some context to coding terminology, I started learning PowerShell. <br><br>It was a game changer; I made CLI and GUI tools for simplifying complex tasks, scripts that glued services together, and automated various tasks. It also opened up the vastness that is Azure and Office 365, which only offer maybe 40% of their features and settings via GUI. <br><br>My latest project is a program that can run and manage multiple stopwatches, which I needed as I work on multiple tasks throughout the day. It started small, and it grew to have a limit of 18 quintillion stopwatches, Cisco-style user input, autorefresh and sorting, and soon it will be able to handle multiple commands at once. <br>Is it overkill? Absolutely, it reached absurd levels of complexity long ago. But do I have fun? Hell yeah.
I dust wanted to learn html🥲
Sir, you got a subscription, my first ever subscription on YouTube
❤
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pEfrdAtAmqk&amp;t=933">15:33</a> this is actually what my teacher back in school wanted to teach us in our first year of having IT class. I was completely flabbergasted and got absolutely lost. All I wanted was to write hello world and got absolutely demotivated because of or not xor and xnor. <br><br>Now I know why. Fuckin hell
That really devolved toward the end there
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pEfrdAtAmqk&amp;t=914">15:14</a> - REAL PROGRAMMERS WRITE DEVICE DRIVERS WITH &quot;cat&quot;...

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pEfrdAtAmqk&amp;t=698">11:38</a> - Well, not so much. They&#39;re ripping out ADA code as fast as they can because they can&#39;t find programmers willing to learn it. At one time I could INSTANTIATE and ELABORATE with the best of them, as I worked a real-time UNIX product with C (or C++), a FORTRAN transcendental and scientific library, and an ADA compiler for the mil-spec guys, all together at one time. Device drivers? Do you want that in C (or C++), FORTRAN or ADA? Oh, yeah... we had a symbolic GUI-based debugger that worked with all four languages, and in assembly, and allowed you to patch code on a running system... and inspect variables on the stack... without stopping the program... yeah...
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pEfrdAtAmqk&amp;t=655">10:55</a> - I still have that manual... somewhere... like my third program was a terminate-and-stay-resident serial port handler...

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pEfrdAtAmqk&amp;t=428">7:08</a> - I didn&#39;t code in C originally - I coded in Harris (as in Harris Corporation) Implementation Language, or HIL, which was C with closed structures (no braces) and some additional low-level reflection facilities. That did not last very long externally, but was used internally for a very, very long time... fully interoperable with C and C++...
my adhd would never allow me to do programming even though i 100% could im just saying this so i dont regret it in the future when i realize i shouldve done things for my future

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pEfrdAtAmqk&amp;t=238">3:58</a> - WAY before Java was Forth, which was threaded-code interpreter which was halfway between assembly and a high-level language. Basically the Forth interpreter was not unlike the Java Virtual Engine and the Forth interpreter created something not unlike the Java bytecodes (or Python bytecodes). Worked on an interpretive language for a robot at the University of Florida we called  Gator Robot-Oriented Working Language (GROWL) which included implementation of locality and trajectories in the language. (Look up Gator Growl - you won&#39;t find robots mentioned...)

C++ is quite easy to learn
This should have been the first x mins of my CS101 class (I flunked and then cheated on my second attempt as I had no interest in programming at that point)
Whats wrong with you? HTML &amp; CSS are NOT A PROGRAMMING LANGUAGE!<br>What is your definition of Tech Community? People that have no degree in something techy?<br><br>Goddammit, its not even touring complete. I proofed that my software synthesizer is turing complete, but html&amp;css are both in no way programming languages.<br><br>For these &quot;tech amateur community&quot;: formal languages describing something without logic are called DESCRIPTION LANGUAGES. You can create a Document with them, but no Program.
R built in New Zealand.Good
Knowledge is the information God bestowed upon His creation.
Where&#39;s Matlab?
HTML and CSS my beloved.
&quot;html and css combined together are turing complete&quot;??? ... wow, do you even know what &quot;turing completeness&quot; means? you got it all wrong, you will be cancelled by anyone who made it through a first semester of cs if claiming that html and css are programming languages.<br>You cannot even compute 1+1 with html and css only, let alone &quot;compute everything that is computable&quot; - which is what &quot;turing completeness&quot; means.
Hi.can somebody answer my question:<br>Im new to programming and i am learning python for coding it&#39;s better to code in visual code studio or pycharm?
You can actually program in logic gates using verilog or vhdl hardware description languages. They also have procedural functionalities so you can test those gates
It went from... Starting out, to actually useful, to niche languages, to memes, to genius level learning to a psychological trauma to every starting programmer<br>God I love it
Holy crap, APL looks amazing<br>Why have I never looked into it before now
AI has knowledge of it all. You didn&#39;t cover the language I wrote back in college, lol.
Then AI came 😂 and did all the work we can do in these languages 😢
Hot take: C is the best beginner language
Piet is pronounced like Pete, y&#39;know like the name
bro went to transistors from programing language 🤣🤣🤣
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pEfrdAtAmqk&amp;t=996">16:36</a> the only thing we really know is that we know only 1 thing which is that we know only 1 thing.
alternate title: history of programming languages + nerd jokes
you forgot cow :(
The most important skill in software engineering is to only learn what you need to achieve the next step of your current project.<br>Or you will go insane.
You forgot YAML
Censorship is genocide.
I&#39;d rather program in a weird fun language than f,ucking Rust or Javascript.
Rust is overrated and stupid. It will never replace C++.
Charles Babbage was the first programmer.
Elixir is just Erlang with worse syntax. Erlang is much more relevant and modern than Elixir. You messed up the placement.
Knowledge is NPM packages registry.
I started getting scared when I was reaching the end of the video and only heard Assembly quickly referenced for the explanation of a separate syntax. I shoulda know it would be at the very bottom of the iceberg lol...
this is not a roadmap, this is a fuckin laberinth my dude
Wait...... APEX ???? all the Salesforce folks are feeling left out
bro went like tech_stupid tech_science_quantum science_psychology_philosophy_spirituality_theory of nothingness
TempleOS is a Russian nesting doll of icebergs
You missed the HDLs !
The only thing I know is that I don’t know anything.
you missed crypto languages like solidity
So basically you&#39;d need to live an entire lifetime to even become an expert in a few of these. Right.
when you said “you don’t wanna be on your death bed wondering if you should have tried out PHP” i went wide eyed because i thought you said PCP 😭😭😭
Atlest now I know that have to learn hacking in ada
My brain began melting at the second-to-last category. But my god... the last 3 things you mentioned are grotesquely complex. When we&#39;re beyond the iceberg I&#39;m at peace😂
*Me at a party*: Hey I program in Rust.
i start with c++ what to do next?
Good trip
No love for Odin?
last but not least is money😌
My first language was pascal, i&#39;ll always remember you buddy...
Can&#39;t wait to code Arduinos with Q#
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pEfrdAtAmqk&amp;t=451">7:31</a> wasn&#39;t it made in Denmark?
this video makes me want to pursue learning software engineer even more. (i&#39;m still stuck with lua and my head exploded when i tried learning java)
Some high computing clusters only accept jobs that are made with Fortran
You forgot ladder logic programming (for PLCs)
i&#39;m disappointed you did not mention Hypercard. i would&#39;ve put it in the esoteric section, but it at least needed an honorable mention. <br><br>it was a fun and interesting video. thanks
Im currently programming aloy in java and recently thought &quot;f*ck it, i think it might be time to go deeper. Maybe rust or C?&quot;<br>This video just made me realize: what the hell am i getting myself into?
Who is here after &#39;Devin&#39; ?

What about ABAP Programming by SAP?
Wow why so look perfect sir <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pEfrdAtAmqk&amp;t=103">1:43</a>
Why does every python dev defend their language like it&#39;s the soviet union. C languages are so much better.
The problem is, I&#39;m 30 and I&#39;ve worked at companies where I was writing proprietary assembler code and walking to mainframe rooms to stick tape drive in terminals and reading octal dumps (yea octal lol) in code reviews for 2 hours to being a complete full stack Next.js serverless backend AWS Kinesis streams step functions cloud watching code hipster at companies. I know it ALL lol.
Can we simultaneoulsy use all these languages to make one single project?
Take the Christ pill.<br>Thank me later.
Fireship you rock!!!!!
Sceratch damn sucks
on my coffe break here first 45 sec got me cracking up bc of the puns omfg
ngl things got much easier to grasp once entered the realm of semiconductors and further.
I&#39;m gonna write quantum C
HTML is not a programming language
visual basic?
LOOOOOOLLL!!!
They should be teaching this at universities, seriously
As a cobol dev:<br>...........Please end me
Never in a million year did I expect to have some philosophy talk in this channel, but what is life without surprises?
Been programming on C, C++, C# and Java for past 5 years. Had some nasty encounters with Python and JS and for the life of me can’t stand them. The syntax is so messy, everything is so ambiguous. I’m so angry that people can find jobs by simply learning one of those yet it is practically impossible for me to learn and master
Uh...
surprised to not see ahk on here
This video should get more views
This is not the roadmap video this video is about how many languages there are and the ranking of them 👎🏻
This video is so much fun! You forgot vhdl and verilog.
ive done c++ python javascript html/css  am i safe??
Incredible resource for learning programming. Really helped me grasp the basics.
Very cool video, thank you!
This was a wild ride. I&#39;ve dabbled in programming a few times and recently decided to take a deep dive and go back to college for computer science. I have four five week classes coming up on Python, JavaScript, C++ (which I learned a bit in college 20 years ago), and SQL. Pretty damned excited, honestly. I can&#39;t wait to get to a point where I can feel comfortable playing around with some of the more obscure languages.
I use bluprint in UE4/5 does that mean I know c++?
Also in college, I remember at least a handful of students that wanted to get into programming but struggled with basic concepts because their mind just wasn&#39;t wired that way. It was obvious that they lacked the natural talent required to be a professional programmer. When going into a CS interview there will be no AI support and candidates will be asked a series escalating coding problems to determine their knowledge and skills. Imaging being asked to code a Mandelbrot algorithm on a white board as the first coding question, and then asked how it can be optimized. Canidates can&#39;t BS there way through a technical interview. They can, or they can&#39;t solve the problem. But, depending on the complexity of the problem, getting close can be OK. Never give up solving it until asked to stop. Need to be a dog that is obsessed with a bone. They want to see if a candidate gives up on solving a coding problem that has becomes become difficult.
isn&#39;t javascript a scripting language?
This video is very entertaining. <br>Lolcode 😊<br><br>HAI 1.2<br>VISIBLE &quot;Hello, World!&quot;<br>KTHXBYE

Well at my uni they simply dumped to you a ton of languages and you had to deal with it somehow (SQL, C, C++, C#, JS, html, css, sql, Python, assembly, lisp, bison, Java) then working I only learnt Typescript and IaC

Coding is likely just too complicated and will need to be simplified via AI to make it as user friendly, accessible as possible. In the future, programming may be more of a creative field using VR headsets rather than reading lines of text. 🤔
No way someone actually mentioned LISP. I use it in my drafting software AutoCAD. it can be used to write custom commands and processes in the software, very fun stuff.
Fantastic review!
I started with The Cs, C#, C++ and C for game development.
For a sales and operations guy like me, VBA would be the top. I&#39;m guessing VBA is not counted as a programming language lol.
The iceberg went deeper than I expected 😂
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pEfrdAtAmqk&amp;t=119">1:59</a> This is the programming language you will ever need as a front end developer, that is JS and maybe also TS.
C  &gt;  python
Ah yes, a great video that starts with a how-to-code language made for kids and beginners and ends with existential crisis. Pleased to say that I have quit programming and have started philosophy.
You forgot coding with eternal all/nothingness
Java is unbelievably frustrating with its extremely long syntax and stupid camel casing and oop Obsession
I&#39;m a Primary School student and the <a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23learntocode">#LEARNTOCODE</a> languages(we had to use them in a P2 activity) actually suck. maybe it was because now i&#39;m already writing my own code in Python and Bash
And this is why... I&#39;ll always have a job, thanks for confirming!
This inspired me to Become The Best and Very Profitable and Desired Programer
I hate JavaScript, far more confortable with C or Python and spent many months learning Django for my web portfolio.Eventually gave up and went with the tried and tested holy trinity (HTML,CSS,JS) and oh boy it was a dumpster fire!
I think I will stick with the script from the island of java.
Great overview of allll the things 😅
AWESOME 🔥🔥🔥
Visual Basic 6 was my start down the path. Some BASIC before that. Then PHP with the rise of the internet, and a dip in Pascal. Then Visual C#, and Javascript. <br><br>Kinda stuck at this point. Node or PHP. Not sure I want to keep going into Go or Python or anything else. <br>PHP is the pinnacle of web programming 😊
HTML is not a programming language, and neither is SQL.
You only need PHP and Javascript. None of this bs.

Tard.
After that video i dont feel so bad anymore with my C, C++ and Assembly skills
Absolutely love the ending. That&#39;s why I&#39;m subscribed.
Well done, but you missed the mark on that last one. It should have been biological coding, ie programming in DNA. We are barely scratching the surface in that field, and yet it&#39;s the field of life itself.
dream maker not mentioned, not true iceberg

This just in: OpenAI has developed AI that just made most of coding totally obsolete. Your jobs were here, and you were needed. Now you are not. The future is here. Dey tuk urrr J0bZZZZ
One of the cool things about data science is that I can use data science to show how much data science I need to learn and give a deep analysis of why I don&#39;t have a job in data science😀

do i need to know all of it tho
How it starts and how it ends
No love for matlab :(
i have no inclination to become a developer but i have enjoyed learning LUA. it just speaks English to me. i enjoy it. it&#39;s because of Awesome WM i&#39;m into it and want to learn more. i&#39;m not fast or always accurate. i am just a fan.
no matter the language, just be good at it
low level programmers here
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pEfrdAtAmqk&amp;t=696">11:36</a> 😂
My first language was Turbo Pascal. 9th grade in a German gymnasium. That was in 2009. After that I learned a bit of HTML, CSS and vanilla JS.<br>During my apprenticeship we learned PLC programming and here i am 15 years later learning Python to switch careers to programming. I wonder, if that&#39;s the right choice, now even more after seeing your video 😊 currently I&#39;m enrolled in Codecademys CS career path. I did finish py4e before that already 😅
bro went too far
HTML Is not a programming language.  It is a Markup Language.  It says it right there in the name.  Same as XML or YAML.  They are Markup Languages.  Stop kidding yourself.  CANCEL ME!!!! DO IT!!! COME AT ME BRO!

hi<br>i have a little question<br>im very interested into programming and i want to program a video game but here is the thing i have adhd and it&#39;s very effecting my productivity lately I can&#39;t even do program using blueprints or noncode Methods to program a game <br><br>is there a more basic and easier Ways to learn programming?
I had deep suppressed emotions that were burdening me and this roadmap finaly let me cry and sob them out, thanks.
I’m learning full stack development. Little by little. February 2025 I’ll be back here to announce what I have achieved in one year
King Terry made Holy C with the help of god!
You forgot Relay Ladder Logic.
Cries in perl 🥲🥲🥲
I started with scratch then got put straight into java
The ending is wholesome ❤❤❤❤
For all we know God could be written in JavaScript
Looking to coding and computer science as a career change. Hardcore pumped. Watched your video. It was great.<br>Anyway, gonna go build timber frame houses.

My programming journey started by making games on scratch, I then switched to Roblox because of how many convenient features it had, and now I’m learning c# to start working on unity
programming languages and their cause of survivals<br>scratch survived - kids need it<br>python survived - easy syntax<br>JS survived -web development can&#39;t be done without it<br>C# - windows needed it<br>php - wordpress and larvel saved it<br>swift - apple worked for it<br>java - corporate world and android adopted it<br><br>C, C++ survived : if they didn&#39;t survive you won&#39;t survive as developer<br>Rust, Go, Zig - are amazing languages and is loved by community<br><br>idk much about other languages

The Rockstar programming language also enables you to write code that looks like a 1980s hard rock lyrics.<br><br>And I might have missed any mention of Perl in this video.
Coward, you put Jesus smoking a cigarette in the thumbnail but you would shit your pants using depiction of Allah as a thumbnail.
standing ovation
Personally I really love a high level language called VHDL -- much nicer than schematic :)
wait what did he say abou ayoaska trip?
This went from Scratch to epistemology really quick
I&#39;d rather code in binary than malbolge
I&#39;M missing the DNA Programming
Great video. But, no Verilog? 😊<br><br><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Verilog">https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Verilog</a>
For me my journey:<br>Kotlin<br>Java<br>Go<br>Dart Flutter<br>HTML CSS JS<br>Assembly 8086 <br>C++<br>And got my hands dirty with some others for a couple of hours but those are the languages I&#39;ve put some effort in learning and codded with for a while
Nice cable guy reference!
I hate it that I know every language before Esoteric. I did a module in UNI called programming language concepts where they showed how a programming concept is implemented across all languages. Up to a point where we were implementing Records across all OO languages and and representation of classes in functional languages. They almost even convinced us that all of this can be done in HTML, most of us hit the pause button at that point.
You missed VHDL and Verilog…
You forgot the best one of them all.... TI
The fun part is that I understand everything down to C before then blanking out completely until we arrive at assembly which is something I understand again, machine code, hardware design on the transistor level, all easy, and then we do quantum stuff and I blank out again.
You should start from.. <b>scratch</b> 🤭
As a bystander i do not understand, why is there a need for so many languages in the first place? why isnt there a single &quot;meta&quot; programming language that everyone is agreed on to use?
I didn&#39;t watch the video yet but this thumb is fking exaggerated<br>Ppl gonna be afraid of learning programming by this<br>It&#39;s not like that, eventually you&#39;ll learn part of those and some it&#39;s not a matter of learn at all. Since you learned any programming language, the those other will be like reusing your programming knowledge.<br>It&#39;s a lot easy to start learning programming and involves just 3 of those things atleast<br>Please do something good and change this thumb
Nice, I am at work now writing some c# code.<br>And you made me feel overwhelmed and wanting to quit!
mandlebrot is a good name for a linux distro...
If [C and C++ are low-level part of the Ice-mountain] then ASM is binary?<br>And later claims [Fortran was first High-level before C came], where if [C is high level] then C++ and Python are Alian-technology-level. Tip, C is medium-level. You think there&#39;s only black and white, only low and high.
But html is not a programming language
Years ago in highschool in my electronics class I made a version of a Pong game with a PIC16 microprocessor (if I remember the IC) and other various parts while everyone was making LEDs flash or making a tiny speaker beep, sure it wasn&#39;t exactly solely using transistors but hell I was soo excited the first time seeing it boot up and it ran. Only issues were that one of the buttons were broken and I had no replacement and the teach keep my project in the end.
BRB gonna code Doom in epistemology
Fun and useful video thx
public class Main {<br>    public static void main(String[] args) {<br>        System.out.println(“Hello World”);<br>}<br>}
Haskell, not productive use? You need to revisit Haskell. Also, C is not that easy to learn. Its paradigm is tricks and traps!
The ending is the best kkkkk
After all I’m doing Wordpress 😢
So this is just the abstraction of computer science
I graduate from highschool soon<br>And I really wanna do computer science<br>However this video is scaring me, I had zero knowledge of all these things<br>The next 4yrs are gonna be tough
rust is for transexuals
10 years ago!
What if I make my own programming language that slaps all of that? (Is a joke)
as a kid I desperately wanted a laptop, In the mid to late 90’s laptops were the coolest thing in the world to me: the holy grail. I used to take big books and flip up the back cover and draw a keyboard on the last page and pretend I had a laptop lol. One day my Dad brought home a laptop he snagged from work that wouldn’t boot into Windows anymore. I sat and messed with this thing 24/7. I could use it in DOS and eventually I discovered a little gem called Qbasic which was installed on there. That basically consumed me from age 9-13. I wasted so much time trying to create ambitious projects in Qbasic. I was basically self taught through analyzing the few sample programs it came with like snake, the gorilla game, and some kind of rudimentary money manager program. It was a very exciting time and I often wonder what would have happened if I stuck with coding and tinkering with computers. Now I don’t know what the hell is going on. I know some basic Python and that is about it.
Pascal! man I miss coding in that. In high school we started in scratch for a semester, then spent the next year coding in pascal.
To think the first language we learned in university was Assembly...
I liked watch this video, not long but explains so much 🙂
And here I am at 32 just starting out with C. No prior background. 🥴
Bro gone too deep into the iceberg he actually gone through earth and gone missing into the void
You forgot geometry dash, minecraft, terraria, and desmos
C#?
Best video EVER!!
The only thing that I really know is that I know nothing....................................
Sorry but not sorry HTML is not a programming language
Assembly left the chat
I was born in the 2000s but I distinctly remember learning Pascal in middle school.
Very good job, thank you for your time and effort. The only but I would like to express is about lack of several languages in the bottom part. You didn&#39;t mentioned any of hardware languages such as vhdl, verilog or systemC. There are also some others, but those 3 are major
&quot;must learn how to learn and fail&quot;
Quoting Fireship  &quot;You wouldn&#39;t want to be on your death bed without trying PHP&quot; !!!! hahahahaa. Then the baby riding the cat! Man where do you come up with all of these fun and crazy humour. I always get a good laugh when I come to your videos. It never fails to amuse me. Please carry on doing all of the hard work you do in order to make such awesome videos! Loads of love and support from me!
To anyone trying to learn programming from the beginning, my best advice is to just pick a language that you like at first glance. Stop stressing over what language you need to start with, because the most important skill of all is to begin to think like a programmer. You will never have as much of a challenge learning a language as you do your first one. And no specific language is going to make it that much easier because you are training your brain to think in a way that is fairly alien to the way most of us go about our day to day lives. But once it <b>clicks</b> and you begin to think like a programmer, you can pick up and become functional in another language in a week or sometimes even just a weekend. You just need to first get used to breaking problems down and solving them with basic yes/no questions and then you are on your way
Your video proves there&#39;s a self-punishing trait on those who pursue programming.<br>Thank you for enlightening what my psychiatrist said.
Its crazy that schools in my country start from the bottom of the iceberg then travers up, blessed be thy
Here I am, not knowing how to center in CSS
the only word i have now &quot; Fuckkkkk &quot;
What did I just watch? Last step is the most  craziest. If you know them you are god of computer programming!!!
Oh yeah, reminds me that our school made us learn C++ as our very first programming language. Fun times
That garbage colection is intense 😂
Is there screaming in the background?
this voice is so sleep inducing
i know binary 😂
The year is 2100. We finally implemented the perfect replacement to C that interop with C, C++, Rust, Carbon... and etc.
A friend of mine who went into coding several years back told me an interesting tale:<br><br>The whole class was tasked with creating a computer virus each, which would be uploaded to an isolated hard drive to see what happens.<br><br>One dude wrote his virus entirely in assembly, which no one else in class was willing to do. <br><br>Once uploaded, the hard drive started humming loudly, and after a few moments, the most horrible screeching sound filled the entire classroom, and the test computer with isolated hard drive completely shut down. Nothing on it worked anymore, and if I remember the tale right, turning the computer on again simply wasn&#39;t happening. <br><br>When the professor asked the student what he did exactly, the student explained how he programmed the assembly virus to spin the hard drive way past the safe limit (not sure how fast, but my friend was adamant that the spin alone was enough to do serious damage), and then made the hard drive spin BACKWARDS, utterly destroying the hard drive in the process. <br><br>Not long after, some government representatives came by to talk to this dude, and my friend says no one saw or heard from him ever again. He suspects the dude landed a very high-profile government job by completely destroying a hard drive using assembly.
i like turtles.
I can hear yelling in background
You missed VHDL.
I did start my programming journey at the end, wondering how the hell anything exists and weirder still how the computer can make such pretty pictures
The ending was epic 😂
Brainfucked
Damn you really reached the depths with that ending. What a trippy journey
I don’t know anything about coding but I have decided to start by learning C++
i think basic should be at the below because after leraning python then learning basic i forgot python and cant code basic also
Too scared to write about matlab i see
My man went from programming language staircase to straight up philosophy
C language stands for chad language
You&#39;re wrong dude. You start programming by learning a hardware near mid-high level programming language like C/C++, then later when you get a job you either use that, or use one of the simpler even higher level ones like Python, or you go for the deep dive and learn Cobol or lower level languages, all the way down to assembly, for specialized jobs.
Started with C and ended at JS, I&#39;ve been crawling from the bottom of the iceberg to the top.
Nice video!
Holy C
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pEfrdAtAmqk&amp;t=197">3:17</a> Brazzilian mentioned🤓🇧🇷
Bhailang lovers♥ <br>👇Hit like!
This video just explained my life!!! Stopped at Assembly code, then into philosophy!
I am surprised how many languages are made to replace C but no language is able to. It&#39;s truly a GOAT. <br><br>Huge respect for rust though.
This reminds me of different Bible translations.
As someone that started teaching myself C++ as my first language Jan 1st, I can honestly say I’ve learnt g++ ……. .CPP and ./a.out. <br><br>That is all, but I’m having fun 😂
This video inspired me to go deeper, I am a web developer for 10 years now and yet the deeper tear of the iceberg still looks totally new to me. 😂
Taught my self vb, html, java script, graphic design, played with python and c when I was like 13. By the time I became an adult and it was time to pic a career I was done with PCs, still to this day I hate pcs and only use phone. Burned out making malicious software, password stealers, brute force crackers, and form mail spammers. 🤷
Damn, so I started at the bottom of the iceberg. All philosophical and now find myself in the position of learning a language because I never understood the urge to code because of the variety and hated IT being exponential, ultimately having lead us to Ai which made me want to understand the code so I can bitch at it 🥲
You&#39;ve inspired me to… try Ayahuasca ;)
Iam an electrical and information engineer and I don&#39;t give a wet fart for &quot;what language&quot;. If you don&#39;t have a idea of what you want to create, you are lost.<br>If you have an idea what you want, you can do it in almost any kind.<br>I hate it when people start to talk about what languages they know.<br><br>I&#39;m facing every day new challenges/questions and then I start my brain and use the tool I&#39;m given and make it work.<br>I never used VBscript and within I made a fully automated device testing program that controls batterys and high voltage power supplies. I just knew what I want to do and did it.<br>You have some benefits if you know all the syntax tricks of a specific language. I have lot of knowhow in Matlab and have a lot of experience in &quot;avoiding&quot; loops.<br><br>But in the end, no matter how many languages you speak. If you don&#39;t know what you want to say, your languages are useless🤷🏻‍♂️
How could you miss Forth?
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pEfrdAtAmqk&amp;t=980">16:20</a>   is worth it
ill just stick with python...
they first taught us c then c++ and then we are learning assembly what the hell dude
I&#39;m not seeing Lisp mentioned here?
I’m a C++ developer and I think C++ isn’t too hard to learn. But setting up everything including C++ libraries is absolutely painful. According to google, SFML is the easiest library to set up and ever since before Christmas (around the 20th December), I’ve been trying to setup SFML. Searching up tutorials, following them bit by bit making sure everything is perfect but I still get errors. If I can’t setup SFML by February, I may consider learning java script and stick with building console applications with C++

I have achieved enlightenment and have become a nascent soul. This lower world cannot sustain my knowledge so it is rejecting me. I must ascend to a higher world with other beings like me. I wish you peasants good luck.
assembly. il end it there
I wish I start highschool now so I could learn python at school. when I was 15 I used assemby and turbopascal, at university I started with c++ and then java. after 15 years of Java work I&#39;ve seen that with python even my mum could start programming. it is so naif
Absolutely incredible 🙏
Kinda out of context<br><br>I would like anyone to give insights on whether it&#39;s worth it to get the &#39;Java SE 8 Programmer I (associate)  | 1Z0-808&#39;, followed by &#39;Java SE 8 Programmer II (pro) | 1Z0-809&#39; certifications. It&#39;s almost 2024 now and Java 17 has been released already. In this option, I&#39;d have to take both exams to get the pro badge<br><br>or just go for &#39;Java SE 11 Developer | 1Z0-819(professional)&#39; , which is just one exam<br><br>or the &#39;Java SE 17 Developer | 1Z0-829&#39;(professional), also one exam<br><br>Been programming in Java for about 2yrs now and I feel confident that I will make it through the &#39;1Z0-809 (assoc)&#39; exam but that means I&#39;ll have to pay twice (assoc and pro exam), which is a bit costly. Sitting for the pro exams ((1Z0-819 or 1Z0-829) from the get-go, without an assoc cred) is kinda intimidating. keep in mind that I&#39;m also considering the versions of Java, that the exams test knowledge on. <br><br>What would you go for? Is it a great idea to sit for the Java 8 exam in 2024? is it wise to go pro level exam without clearing assoc first?<br><br>Would appreciate any tips or advice. thank you:)
the last 2 minute is the key element for the whole thing
Commenting to see if there are people using Fortran like me…

He did not mention  D language.
The farther down the list you go, the more shat-in adult diapers are needed.
Typescript is pretty solid these days.
I love how the more complicated topics got older and older, and older.
Bro, Racket is so much easier to learn than Java, and even Python. It has the best documentation ever, and it actually makes you learn the fundamentals of programming. <br>I only learned how properly doing a recursion because of Racket.

Outstanding piece of art!
My electrician be a low level programmer.
There&#39;s a programming language called J#, which is only used by Microsoft India&#39;s office in Hyderabad. Really makes you wonder what they are doing out there.
You are the coolest! Thanks a ton!
Perl being in &quot;Historically Important&quot; really hurt.
this has always been my go to video for introducing beginners to the programming world always love this video
Always use Python over bash if possible, trust me on that one
the olny thing i know is that i don&#39;t know nothing

Programming with epistemology.
What coffee are you drinking ?
For any newbies: if all this seems overwhelming, don&#39;t worry. The stress of the work will eventually expose you naturally to deeper layers of programming. <br><br>After 1-2 years, a lot of things mentioned in this video will become part of your vocabulary.<br><br><br>Also, tip as a senior: suffer. Yes, really. Suffer. That&#39;s how you get better above everyone else
Me whose second programming language is c++: C++ can&#39;t be that hard!<br>C++: say hello to my little friend
What about Q Language ?
I never knew this much about languages. Brilliant video. I am learning Python now but I decided my next is definitely assembly or x86
Q# would have been a cool language to talk about.
The Socratic end was terrifying!
what
Im not gonna lie...this made me rethink my life lol
the ending tho. well done FS 🤣
I remember when I started coding in Python I struggled real hard. Not only with the thinking process but with the fact that the language takes a lot of stuff for granted that I didn&#39;t. I started with Pascal in school and wondered that I didn&#39;t need to declare variables, had no idea what variable type I had each time - I thought in a way too complicated for the language. Still my problem.<br>I often say I do quantum computing because I am too stupid to understand how normal computers work. With understand I mean understand each level and layer. Modern computers are way too complex. <br>A good friend once told me that he sucks at coding as well. He is one of the best hackers in my home country and suffers from the same issues I do.<br>What I still don&#39;t get is object orientated programming though.
You missed Verilog &amp; VHDL when talking about the logic gate stage
Was not expecting Terry A Davis to get a shout out in this video
Piet is not pronounced Pi-et. <br><br>It&#39;s just the Dutch way of writing Pete. <br><br>Or rather, Pete is the English way of writing the Dutch name.

@<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pEfrdAtAmqk&amp;t=130">2:10</a> lol knowing Python or JS doesn&#39;t make you a software engineer. It makes you a scripter at best, perfect for sysadmin stuff. Period.<br>Edit: No mention of Perl, while referencing garbage languages that no one knows? Sacrilege!
That escalated quickly 😂
fck bro , after functional languages my brain stoped braining
i can&#39;t take it anymore

Shout out to those who never needed to get past HTML/CSS/Jquery to make $$$. We happy few.
Aww you missed Rockstar a language specifically named to mess with recruiters looking for &quot;Rockstar developers&quot; code is written in the guise of 80s rock songs
Very nice overview.<br><br>I don&#39;t know how people can listen to &gt; 10 minutes of talk with not a single pause, but I guess it is the style at the time.
Is it just me or is this style of talking or AI generated speech with no spaces or pauses just annoying? How do you get over 2M subscribers from machine generated speech?
I see there is no love for ABAP here either… disappointing

Great video, hadnt laft SO hard in years  Yes, i&#39;m a programmer and rarelly laft or smile for that matter, but great video none the less
Thanks, that was very useful!
You forgot microcode. This is code that translate ISA-level opcode, to data path signals, such as enabling input/output from/to registers, switching muxes, selecting ALU function, etc.
Nope sir you have to start from low level to high level. C and mastering memory concepts as minimum lazy boy.
my brain hurts now
wtf happend at the end?

Great video, although I think programming languages like vhdl which are actually quite used for FPGA are missing.
By mind is spinning 😮
Interviewer : which language do u know?<br>Me : uh hm hm Shakespeare language<br>Interviewer :get the hell uh aut opf here😂😂😂😂
1 y/o here, learnt Q-basic, html,java,c++,asm, c, css, js in this order (only the basic though).I thought java was best among these 💀
me in my first year of computer science at uni unable to write a java program that runs but can write x86 like nobody&#39;s business T-T
There is one more level below assembly which is Cpu micro code, which translates asm instructions into very basic circuit operations.
WTF is going on?
Stackoverflow survey 1965 got me dead! ahah
&quot;I have no idea how it works but it looks cool&quot;

i learned assembly in the college and is so hard i can remember some till today
You forgot VHDL/VERILOG or other HDL languages
go eh o novo c com garbage collection
Our school teaches us and forces us to use Pascal...
Please make scratch a multi function language, to be able to write apps &amp; websites.
C, C++, and Rust are all high-level languages.

I learned to code in Pascal and C and now feel so good about myself 😂😂 (let&#39;s not mention I only did not very complex school projects in it :D )
PHP is underrated.  It&#39;s a great way to get into learning web dev on a budget.  You can do some amazing stuff with it even on the lamest ( and therefore cheapest , Like $2.75 per month cheap ) shared hosting plan.  Sorry JavaScript and Python! 😞.   I love and use both of those as well  btw.😁
So glad I started years ago with C++ as my first language way back in 1993.  Still the fastest and most powerful in 2023.....and it made learning all the other languages I have learned since seem easy.
You knew Jesus was a smoker, right?   Well now you know <i>why</i> .

HTML is a MARKUP language, not a PROGRAMMING language. I will die on this hill, and I am not taking any questions at this time.
Bro. We did Assembly Language in the first year of college 😢😢
As someone who has made it to the bottom, I can say with confidence that you can stay in the middle.
If you learn C++ every other programming language is easy as fuck to learn
You really took a dark turn there at then end.
wanted to see VHDL on the list LOL
what is this
90% of these languages are useless 😂
print(&quot;hello world!&quot;)        😎
I learn one thing today: there are two sides of the programmer, one with decent naming sense and one without.
HTML isn’t a programming language, it’s a markup language. Its structure as opposed to interactivity

Ah yes, transistors, you very briefly touched on how microprocessor technology works at the electrical engineering level. As an EE myself, thanks for the shout out!
I still don&#39;t understand why Python is so popular, how you gonna take away my dear semi-colon and call it a programming language ? it infuriates me.
i like the inclusion of lisp it sure its useless because modern languages took all its good ideas but that syntax is still god tier
I know it&#39;s a joke but HTML is by definition a mark up language, not programming language. However with HTML5 I think I&#39;ll pass on that judgement.

Great vid!
Great list of programming languages.<br><br>Where would you put WebAssembly?
this guy sounds like Neetcode
My favorite is assembler, and that&#39;s not a joke. Optimizations are stupid.
This was hilarious, well done. And yet still informative! I had no idea Rust was the most beloved language.
Did you forget to mention Perl or did I miss it?
Instant sub. This video is art 😂
Wait, is gate logic really that abstract to programmers? <br>I thought it was general knowledge that everybody knew.
Usually iceburgs are highest = most known and lower down is least known, so this was really weird to watch

i understood some of those words :)
I stopped watching when I saw Rust placed at the same level as C and C++? Rust is a meme language.
with WASM, it&#39;s no longer a necessity to learn JS if you want to dabble into web development. You can stick with the language you&#39;re already familiar with and deploy the app as a WASM
Is it uncommon to have 15+ years in the industry and still not know what the hell is going on? 😂

I just can&#39;t, man. Every time anyone calls out Python for having &#39;minimal&#39; syntax post, say, 2017, I die a little inside. Dunders, generator expressions, four methods of string formatting, positional-or-keyword argument soup, tacked on lambdas, the list is not sparse by any means.
its funny to me that when you showed python you showed a corn snake and not a python
only ogs wrote in LOLCODE
When I started studying programming in 2010 the professors started with teaching us C and C++ lmao
We gotta tell the world to stop making more programming languages 😰
&quot;boilerplate code&quot; is only unnecessary unless you have no clue what &quot;boiler&quot; you are on. The same with dynamic type. Fun until its not, and you have no idea what the data in the field actually is, and why the code does not work with other parts of the code.

The only language I can use is R😅
So, if someone wants to be a good programmer, start from 2 years old.
i smoked php once. it was &quot;ight&quot;.
I&#39;m pretty sure that the &#39;S&#39; language from Bell Labs was leveraged into &#39;R&#39;
I’m learning c++ and it’s not as hard as a lot of people make it out to be. I haven’t done a lot of more complex stuff but other then pointers and files it makes a good amount of sense, plus has a good amount of resources online. (Coming from learning c# I was worried I wouldn’t be able to find as much)
So, I decided to write my backend in Forth.

Who is the freaking guy at 8 mins. I keep seeing his face everywhere!
You probably don&#39;t know much about them, hence why you didn&#39;t include them...but what about vhdl and (its inferior brother 🙃) verilog? 😅<br>I would probably order them either on the C level because they are complex and very very low level or at the lowest level because you program hardware directly so it feels more like assembly at times when your multiplier blocks run out.
As an Electronics and Communication Engineer student, bruh moment.
well so we re going to back and back... who created world who created creator... and creator of creator of creator XD
BlitzBasic 🔥🔥🔥🔥
This goes without saying, but for computer science a lot of the time the language doesnt matter - its simply a standard for transferring your human thought into a machine. The hard part of software development isn&#39;t editing code, it&#39;s designing solutions to business problems. After solutions are designed, then they are simply translated to code, and thats where programming languages come in.
The most accuarate part of this programing video was the slow descend into a existential crisis. <br>I applaud the accuaracy and the deep tutorial i&#39;ll make sure to start with the one that match my abilites Scratch. 😂
at this point it is simply esotric
Czechia != Czech Republic 😢 common mistake
Im surprised there was no mention of verilog
Pascal is my first programming language 🐆
where is Pascal
HTML is not a programming language! JFC.
a senior software developer (I worked in the field for nearly 20 years now, PL/SQL, batch, bash, VB, C, C++, Java and probably some I&#39;m forgetting) reacting:<br>No, scratch is an awful place to start. It teaches you none of the basics. Even the log forgotten QBasic would have been better. It may make the base thinking process more accessible, sure, but that&#39;s like learning to sing by playing karaoke in the yakuza games. it teaches you the thinking process of reacting to sounds but nothing more.<br>and basic / Qbasic is also awful because it is way outdated, you can&#39;t really transport the stuff you learn to modern languages without losing most.<br>I&#39;d also recommend against python. Any weakly-typed language is easier than a strongly-typed one, sure, but that leniency makes it that new learners don&#39;t really understand what they do. besides, what was praised as a pro in the vid (no braces, semicolonsm etc) is actually a detriment, because most languages use them and when you get used to a language where line breaks mark the scope, it&#39;s hard to go to a language that doesn&#39;t do this (and vice versa, but most don&#39;t use whitespace as instructions)<br>And I wouldn&#39;t call JS a high level language. It&#39;s a script language, not a programming language. Batch, Bash, Powershell, etc are also not programming languages. html and css even more not so. And no, I never encountered a single person that would cancel anyone that says &quot;html is not a programming language&quot;. In fact, you would be cancelled if you said it was, because it isn&#39;t. It&#39;s in the name ffs, Markup Language.<br>And no, SQL is not a programming language either. Even PL/SQL, which is closer to a programming language, isn&#39;t one.<br>Honestly, none of these should really be in any vid comparing programming languages.<br>I disagree that java is a dumpster fire for beginners. Yes, some things are a bit more verbose than they would have needed to be (but that diminished heavily over the years, most examples you find are from years ago where reading a file included micromanagement like buffer and stuff while today it&#39;s just Files.readAllBytes()), but imposing having to make classes and shit is good for beginners, as many modern languages are object-oriented and that forces them to think in that way. (also, fuck intellij, eclipse for life lol. probably just a &quot;getting used to&quot; thing but whenever I&#39;m forced into intellij I wish it was eclipse)<br>promoting functional languages as the &quot;more based&quot; option sits wrong with me. Sure, they have their uses. But for most jobs, they&#39;re not the way to go. If you wanna get into programming, don&#39;t look into them unless you want to severely restrict the jobs you can get.<br>&quot;Rust doesn&#39;t have a garbage collector&quot; - neither does C, and neither does C++ unless you count autopointers which were a pretty recent addition, back when I used it they were only in the boost library. But I wouldn&#39;t call it garbage collection.<br><br>and.. esoteric but no brainfuck2d? no whitespace? no chef? my fav is BF2D just because the code looks so nice<br><br>anyway, wrote too much already.<br>for beginners, I really encourage you to use java. I like java (many don&#39;t but fuck em) and it has all the key elements you find in other modern often used languages. Strong types, proper scoping, object oriented. polymorphism, etc. Java makes it relatively easy to switch to, say, C++ or C# (which is basically c++ and java mashed together) or any modern language that doesn&#39;t try to reinvent the wheel, and java is not too hard to learn. You can also start with C# for the same reasons, but java has a graphical interface framework (spring) that works everywhere, while with c# you can use windows forms but that works on windows and not anywhere else, you need to use third party tools if you want it to run on apple or mobile or.. And seeing how a graphical interface is nowadays probably what most new programmers want as soon as possible..
Where is VHDL or Verilog
you forgot MATLAB

HTML and css are not programming languages. Its just markdown and styling thereof. Putting them below js and python is as nonsensical as putting the English language in a maths discipline tierlist. Not even going to finish the video.
HTML is NOT a programming language
hahahaha i love you bro
people who got high and saw this are having a swell time
Epic ending bro! There is an actual wormhole in logic, which connects you directly from hardcore maths to hardcore philosophy. Kinda strange place…
Yeah its definitely the ayahuasca
My god, what did I do to myself
but where does vim fit into all of this
Assembly is such a high level “language” it can hardly even be considered a language. That’s why I like to manipulate individual photons to excite molecular logic gates
Delphi? D?
Am right now learning C# and Java. Man it is total nightmare to learn them!!!!!!!!! Please help me!!!
I&#39;ve recently started programming, java mainly, I&#39;m a nooby noob still, but I feel like I&#39;ve come across a rabbithole and I&#39;m not sure where I&#39;m going to end up or how long I will be gone...
In my university, the first programming language they teach us is C, followed by C++ and then moving on to assigning us projects (e.g. Artificial Intelligence, if you choose to take this subject later on) requiring knowledge of Python without actually spending time to teach us this language at that point. C is a very good beginner language because, like it was stated in the video, it&#39;s the language without which, a lot of the &quot;big&quot; ones in the industry now wouldn&#39;t exist.<br><br>Edit: They also teach us Assembly in the 1st year for the mandatory subject &quot;Computer Architecture I&quot; which as you can imagine is a pain in the ass...

Great ending
The best language to learn an actual legitimate language is probably C. It’s simple, low level, and you can still do a lot. After that, you’re going to want to upgrade to object oriented programming, so C++, Python, and Java, probably in that order. After that, JavaScript, C#/.NET, and other more developer based programming.<br><br>ChatGPT is a legitimate resource to help you code. You just got to use it write and make sure you’re understanding the concepts.
As someone who barely understand printing (&quot;hello world&quot;) in python<br><br>...<br><b>what</b>
from 0 to 100 real quick
My fucking god in some years we are going to have more coding languages than actual languages, why in the world there&#39;s no convention and everyone is doing what they want? We need an unified universal coding language.
There are definite evolutionary dead ends. And as a Developer you should get a &quot;feel&quot; of why you like or don&#39;t like certain languages. Elixir for example... is a dead end. Weak typing, runtime interpretation,  .. all the pitfalls of java script...
Go Elm!!! 🎉
HTML and CSS are NOT programming languages.

Perfect. Only FPGA is missing for me in that video :)
As someone who is a complete programming illiterate who has always loved video games theres a certain question thats been on my mind for years now.  If one wanted to make a huge modern big budget game, lets lets say elden ring or somthing of that scale but stubbornly wanted to use only machine code.<br>Would that even be possible? <br>How long would it take? <br>If one were to use a more standardized modern language how much easier would it be and how much time would be saved?
HOLY CHİT
We started with Java at school. If I know some of it, will stuff like JavaScript, Python, and C and C++ be easier, or more difficult :(
Right... so... I have made small circuits with logic gates using transistors directly. Onesuch I made to control the channel switching of a tube amplifier I made. I never thought of it as a program, in fact, and less even as using a &quot;language&quot; (I think the concept doesn&#39;t apply here, really). <br>That&#39;s crazy cause I&#39;m busting my a** to learn C++ now, which is suposedly more accesible to a human. <br>I know a dude who programs in Assembly and he is outright scary. You wouldn&#39;t want that guy in a sinking ship deciding who lives and dies, I&#39;ll just say that.
this isn&#39;t a roadmap it&#39;s a barely organized list of languages or tools with random historical anectodes
That was one heck of an ending.
My 1st coding language is c 💀
It gets freaky a the end
I would like to say I understand everything in this video, but that&#39;s a complete lie. 😅
You’ve inspired me to finally quit selling drugs to hoodlums on the crumbless streets of antwerps, and pick up programming. Thank you

Jr developer joke at the beginning isn&#39;t even a joke. And you better have 20+ years of experience with all of them!!!
the fact that I took racket my first semester of college..
we need a 2023 version of this video &lt;3
So what do I learn…
I wonder how people who start with python actually understand any other language later on. They practically lack half of the necessary knowledge for a programmer, that&#39;s why I&#39;d never hire somebody who knows only python.
Honestly&lt; if ure trying to learn programming seriously and to make a career out of it, there is no better option than c++. It teaches u the basics, isn&quot;t as hard as this dude made it out to be and helps u understand how memory management works. It also helps to build logic, which will make learning all the other languages easier.
But wat if God is a subdomain, not a domain???
I have always been mildly, passively interested in coding as a hobby, but dude, your videos have hyper-charged my interest! I&#39;m already doing side coding projects at work, but now I want to dive head first into it. Thanks, your video style is inspiring and entertaining!
😂😂😂<br><br>So we really don&#39;t know how any of this works, we&#39;re just winging it. <br><br>Monkey pull lever, Monkey gets a shock, Monkey stop pulling lever. <br><br>Man pull lever, Man get a shock, Man still pull lever.
funny and educational
How we know what we know about CS
I learned programming on C and C++ and I got to say they&#39;re pretty great to begin with to fundamentally understand the flow of the software and memory menagment. It&#39;s like learning to swim by jumping directly in to deep waters. If you learn to code functional, stable apps in those language I think you&#39;re ready to go.
I come here to curse the sadistic bastard who thought it was a good idea to have 2 classes with assembly on the 2nd year of my computer science course
First language I tried to learn was C++ 😂<br>(because of minecraft)<br><br>Then I tried python because C++ is just &quot;Ehh&quot;
As a junior dev looking for inspiration - that made me finally go to sleep to have nightmares. That&#39;s enough internet for today. Thank you.<br>P.S. Loved the video.
Starting assembly this week and then machine language, we learn low level in my university at least
Thanks for mentioning my homeland Vietnam 😉<br>Greetings from Berlin.
what about swift?
Imagine just seeing someone coding by typing 0&#39;s and 1&#39;s really fast. It would be like looking at an encrypted image or text 99.999% of people would not even be able to know what he is doing
I&#39;m learning c++ in high school and I find the pointers and the pass-by-referece a bit complicated but I kinda see why we learn c++ instead of java or python. C++ it&#39;s like a base programming and if you learn the synthax and the logic it&#39;s gonna be easy to switch to another programming language.
I regret the time I spent on PHP. If I had used the time to learn JS or Python, it would have paid a lot down the line. SQL has inspired me to go down the line of data analysis and I don&#39;t regret having chosen R as my primary tool now. I am dabbling towards Pyhon now tho.

Thank you for this video, I am shooting myself now
The fact that we started in high-school with C++ scares me =)))
Started with c++ at school, ended up loving c# and once I&#39;m done I&#39;ll go back to c++ And master it as well.
No mention of Perl, not even version 6...😢
I would honestly argue HTML/CSS aren&#39;t programming languages, I think they&#39;re more structure languages than programming. <br>Disclaimer I&#39;m not a full programmer, I&#39;m doing a re-training to learn software development using java and sql, but I have some experience in the unity engine and I have bashed my head in over html/css. Also my dad (teaches java and databases at my local uni) said this, and I just agree with his point.

Dang, that reminded me of the horror show of doing AP C++ in HS about 21yrs ago.  It gave me so, SO many headaches.  Now, I don&#39;t know why, I&#39;m trying to get back into coding for a side gig (AKA I want to earn more $$$).  <br><br>So far, I&#39;ve done C++, Basic, Java, HTML, and CSS.  At the moment, my knowledge is beginner at best with minor concepts of how things work/should work.  I&#39;d love to figure out a good language to program with that&#39;ll be relevant in the next 10yrs with the advent of AI and Quantum Computing, quite possible Quantum AI Computing.

KTHXBYE
as an IT student in college in current, I still don&#39;t understand why my college let their beloved students learn Java at first 🙃 I mean we can clearly see that a large amount of students don&#39;t have foundation in programming and they are super confused when study Java bc of its syntax and method 🙃 just why
got tired of debugging java so i just switched to assembly
I was laughing until we hit the last layer and then saw the logic gates... now i just feel called out
Fun Fact: What is APL<br>&quot;It&#39;s a programing language&quot;
I don&#39;t know why I stayed to see these languages when I just work on JS and Python . Currently learning TypeScript. I dont give a shit about BrainFuck 😂😂
I started with Basic at age 9 in 1991... I hardly knew English at that age.. I simply used the Amiga Basic book that came with my computer and had a few magazines with code listings for a few games... <br><br>It was kind of a steep learning curve, but I got fascinated by how it was possible to tell a computer exactly what to do.<br><br>From there it went to ARexx to batch to HTML, Java script and SSI (what used to be known as DHTML) before I found php.<br><br>Of course, one couldn&#39;t make a truly dynamic homepage without having to deal with SQL, and it was good and pocket money to make, as a junior high around year 2000.<br><br>You may have noticed that  I did my best to avoid strict types and compiled languages... I feared it, seemed too complicated.<br><br>When I finally found the perfect education for me, I ended up managing a small group of servers running Linux in the first 3 years of my apprenticeship... that&#39;s where I met my first love of a language...<br><br>Perl can do everything, and even the most sparse Linux, even today, comes with perl preinstalled. Knowing regular expressions by heart makes it really easy to process whatever text output you face. I ended up knowing perl better than shell script, it was just more flexible.<br><br>However, as my education progressed, I had to face the enemy I feared... strictly typed and compiled languages.<br><br>School taught me ANSI C on a microcontroller platform, my apprenticeship taught me Delphi (pascal) for GUI and PL/SQL for databases beyond the simple MySQL lookup. Luckily Pascal and PL/SQL share a lot of syntax and types.<br><br>C# was kinda easy to learn with a Delphi, perl and C background... Delphi and C#/.NET were designed by the same architect. Java isn&#39;t difficult as such, but finding the right libraries to use is a treasure hunt I never got good at.<br><br>The RADs (rapid application development) were way ahead of Java when it came to easy access to libraries. <br><br>I&#39;ve only recently taken the step to learn python... and I don&#39;t love it. You can typecast your variables, but the interpreter doesn&#39;t stop you from changing the type during execution... it&#39;s basically up to your editor to tell you that you&#39;re doing a mistake.. and an integer has no fixed size or signage... you really have to think about that if you&#39;re doing binary communication with a microcontroller... if I invert a byte binary what is the output?<br><br>Of course one could laugh about Pascal having a longbool, but at least it was predictable.<br><br>On the other hand, python is very maintainable being a JIT language. No need to recompile for various CPUs and operating systems etc. but I miss strict typing when dealing with hardware.
Not what is knowledge, but what is language. Thanks for the value
Bro went from python to quantum physics to philosophy 💀
The world would be a better place if people skipped to the &quot;know thyself&quot; part before coming back and learning Javascript.
He tell us before <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pEfrdAtAmqk&amp;t=965">16:05</a> abt video at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pEfrdAtAmqk&amp;t=5">0:05</a> 😅
The last part showed me bible verse !<br>😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭<br>“And I gave my heart to seek and search out by wisdom concerning all things that are done under heaven: this sore travail hath God given to the sons of man to be exercised therewith.”<br>  — Ecclesiastes <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pEfrdAtAmqk&amp;t=73">1:13</a> (KJV)
How can I deal with all this anxiety now? Thank you &lt;- sacasm
Gotta send this to my friend in Computer Science university struggling with back-end technologies to make him quit for good
Where prolog language 😢
C# is literally the easiest actual programming language imo. No one can change my mind, but tbf I have a bias bc all I can code is a windows forms app.
Amazing i understood nothing
Ok im going to learn python, html and then JavaScript. Wish me luck. <br><br>Complete begginer btw
This is like discovering a whole new based 4orchan meme community 😂
&quot;I saw two cute snakes and got baited hard&quot;<br>-me after learning python and going down the iceberg
I hate sql. Lets stop there surely it doesn&#39;t get worse
blessed holy c
I just started uni and we’re learning C++ first 😭
iowas not real, learn scratch and c, fuck bitches, get dudes, move to the pacific ocean
i&#39;m just staying with 3 programming language ... ok python, c and asm ... how about javascript :)? woahh hold on how about golang &#39;i like the syntax btw&#39; ... how about java wow wow wow hold on hold on how about c# ok im quit now 😂🤣
I was so focused on the language model and then from no were comes brain F.. k
I started my programming journey with c++
Mate at my middle school everyone has a calculator and there’s a 95% chance it has a port of Flappy Bird written in TI-BASIC on it
C++ rocks, should be near the top
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pEfrdAtAmqk&amp;t=583">9:43</a> Pharo is no programming language but an IDE. It supports Smalltalk, a OOP pure programming language mostly used in old transactional information systems like those in banks.s
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pEfrdAtAmqk&amp;t=405">6:45</a> that&#39;s what i was talking about that&#39;s why these are goats
You inspire me kms as a junior developer &lt;3
name a video where you can watch it thoroughly till the end yet simply not understand anything
Bro, I absolutely love your content and your extremely broad and diverse understanding of these topics especially how they are related to nature. Im not sure if you are just joking around on some of the stuff you have stated but the TRUTH is out there. You&#39;re explanation of using lightning on runes not seen with the human eye that use extremely advanced abstractions from nature is on point. The Womb is the entrance this matrix as stated in Exodus. Christ was the programmer that stepped into the program to fix the virus.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pEfrdAtAmqk&amp;t=242">4:02</a> well this may be changing soon. There&#39;s a new JEP out that proposes to add an unnamed class and also allow the main method to be non-static.
Kekw In university you usually start with C
That, was, the most, informative, entertaining, concise, and brutal <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pEfrdAtAmqk&amp;t=1001">16:41</a> about coding that I&#39;ve watched, to date.<br>My brain is smoking.<br>It&#39;s really hard NOT to become a bit paralyzed by all this information (staring across the room, blankly, in a silent stroke). 🤯
WHERE VISUAL BASIC????11!1!!!
That was awesome!
I certainly did not expect to watch this whole thing. But it just kept going deeper and I couldn&#39;t stop.
My brain exploded, or did it even exist?
As someone who started from Scratch at age eleven, I can confirm it&#39;s a great place to start. I&#39;m now developing my own apps with Flutter.
«C was the perfect programming language when it came out in 1969». No.
I felt lost watching this video.
The third time that I saw it and still it made you understand new knowledge.
If you want to become depressed learn COBOL or code PL/1 with the IDZ for Z Systems IDE &lt;- This bullshit IBM Software will make you wanna die xD
Lol the end of this is gold.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pEfrdAtAmqk&amp;t=913">15:13</a> it&#39;s perfect 0,1
You always speak the hard truth, and your channel is damn so straighforward and interesting as always.
I am appalled there is no mention of Q#, which is C# but for quantum computing. You even mentioned quanta themselves!
Yo brainf*<b>*</b> is awesome
Damn... I I only know HTML/CSS/JS and I just learned Python... I suck.
But, what about Age of Empires II scenario editor?
fyi Piet is the dutch version of Pete, and pronounced similarly but with a strong t at the end.
Goddamit
If you don&#39;t want to be on your deathbed wondering if you should have tried PhP, you are going to bed on your deathbed knowing it was PhP that got you there.
me in my mechanical engineering classes still learning matlab XD
My dude, that transistor up there is BJT while in modern VLSI architecture (specially below 10 nm) they use exclusively of MOSFET&#39;s!<br>BTW looneys started teaching us C++ and Assembly back in extra curriculum in our high school and that&#39;s part of the reason of what I am today! I wanted to be an astronaut, DAMN YOU! Back then we didn&#39;t even know what Von Neumann architecture is!
I have a newbie (probably stupid) question. Why bother learning different programming languages when all they do is get compiled to some kind of computer code? Why not just skip a step and program using computer code that CPUs and other types of PUs use? Surely it&#39;s easy to learn.
Lol about ajavska
HTML is not a programming language, never has been, never will be, it&#39;s called markup language from the very second they teach it to you for a reason, it doesn&#39;t have variables, anyone who says otherwise needs special help.
Transistor language is very easy to learn. Ive been a Transistor Developer for 42 years.
Calm down bro
If you aren&#39;t programming on a clay tablet, you&#39;re doing it wrong
That was also convincing until I noticed the glitch, a diversion to keep us enslaved to the machine..... No mention at all of Perl. The glue that holds the internet together. The Swiss army knife of coding, with so many ways to do it (badly). No one else can understand your code, and in two weeks neither can you.
I have spent 5 years programming and I know less now than I did before I picked up my first programming book. But thanks to this video I will try emojicode to redem myself
What the fuck was that?
AAAAAAAAAAAAAA
I love how thorough all this is and how well-organized it is.. I love how thorough all this is and how well-organized it is..
if you can Code in Transistors you deserve $2.5m/month. <br><br>Kinda like the ladies who &#39;sewn together&#39; the computer that went to the moon.
i should never have watched this. I was about 3 minutes into my javascript for beginners tutorial.. about to find a netlix series to watch now.
Always bet on JS you&#39;ll never lose LMAOOO
PLEASE is very important in InterCal. If the programmer doesn&#39;t use it frequently, the code won&#39;t compile, because the programmer was not polite. And if used too often, results in error that the programmer was excessively polite...
Philosophers still don&#39;t have a good answer for epistemology...<br> <br>But you close with Plato, who figured how it is beyond humans to understand, <br>&quot;I know that I know nothing&quot;...and then you follow with Plato&#39;s cave...<br><br>Fireship masterclass
Holy C is actually legit cool. Heard about it quite a while ago and still think it wasn&#39;t a work of god but work of ganja
This video can humble any programmer.
Quantum electrodynamics looks fun
He mentioned his go-to tech stack to build a website in a video a while ago. I can&#39;t find the video. Let me know if any one of you guys know the video.
That escalated slowly
SAP ABAP is not even here. that&#39;s a good enough reason to quit my job, isn&#39;t it !?
Always bet on JS
My headache throughout the video 📈📈📈
lets all make coding a hobby
❤wow.. u just blow my mind Sir.. I will remember you as legend
What the context do you mean by pascal deep down there?
0/10 perl was not mentioned
Damnnnnnnnnnn....it&#39;s a huge jungle
Russian progremmers, creators of Kotli n, went to Chechia and now Kotlin originates from Chechia. You are funny:)
😮
the bottom tip of the iceberg? you&#39;re gonna look to yourself and find the meaning of life.
COBOL!¬!!!! I hate cobol, Learned it a bit in College, about 23yrs ago, and it was horrible....
You forgot Clarity, the smart contract language used on the Stacks blockchain which is built on the Bitcoin blockchain. Its similar to LISP too.
Rust is the best language.
jesus christ
I really like your philosophical closing statement ;)
Matlab is not on here, where should it fit
Very insightful. Thank you.
this video is not for some who just know html,css,java,MySql and learning about Microsoft azure to publish a website
The ultimate brainfuck. NGL!!
No mention of PERL!😅
C hashtag is awesome😁
what is a garbage collector? 🤔
stay away
IDK man, from one perspective, brainfuck is incredibly hard to learn, but from another, it is just incredibly simple. So what is it? Same with assembly, it is essentially just which buttons to press in order on a slightly more complicated calculator.
That does it. My new goto language is going to be Brainfu*k. It&#39;s impossible to keep with the pace of technology, so why not just go big and see if I can teleport my brain to another dimension. 😱
You have to be on the spectrum to even care about any of this
What about VHDL and verliog?
Dude chill XD
came here for mentions of Terry Davis, was not disappointed. Homie BECAME Terry for a moment.
This taught me more about CS than my CS degree
And Im f*cking my head with assembly.
Java, c,c++, c# are only the true programming languages.
Had my fingers in all of the Iceberg by now
I&#39;m sad, you forget FORTH and LOGO, both inspirational
Information Overloaded
I decided this year that I am going to learn how to do everything a JavaScript Framework does, manually. I am so sick of JavaScript frameworks that I finally decided &quot;I&#39;m doing it, and that is it. Keep Svelte, React and Angular. Screw you too Blazor. I&#39;ll do it myself&quot; Everything is just so slow, why is everything just so slow.
ayahuasca hipotesis, very  probable.
I started from C++ and C, now working with C# (Unity)
For me, Python is an absolute perfect language, it is not used everywhere but it is versatile af 🐍❤️
thx now I feel useless after years of Java, Python and SQL..
Why tf was assembly part of my middle school cs curriculum?
what was that bit about go, but without a GC?
10 100 second overviews compended, a very cool rundown on it all! But what about microcode?
Thank You So Much.....🙏🏻🙏🏻🙏🏻🙏🏻🙏🏻🙏🏻
back in 2010 when i was in college I started by learning to code with a software called visualg with the incredible language &quot;Portugol&quot; it was pretty fun! HAHA
Just .............................................................................................. Wow!
You can really stop at electronics here, QED isn&#39;t a legitimate physics field, more like a squiggle session. But at least it makes for good sci fi
this video brings garbage information to newcomers, author you were messed up with the most unimportant thing for being a good programmer, you don&#39;t need to compare the programming languages, it is a waste of time, any programming language is good, choose one of them that is enough, at most 2. One high-level and one for lower level. After gaining the proficiency in one language you will understand all the languages, language will become just a tool which have the same purpose. I am pythonist and C++ is my favorite language, i know bash, and i never took a java courses, but I can understand all the lines that is written in java,  I also understand GO. So, don&#39;t waste your time with languages, pick one and get proficiency, at the end you understand that all languages are the same piece of shit
we learned c the moment i entered first year. i didnt know any programming before that. when i found python, my head still worked in round about ways and finding out shortcut codes made my heart so happy and i thought i found a cheat language not realizing everyone else from the rest of the world learned python first. the pro is that now no matter what language i encounter now, it doesnt phase me anymore. the con is that i get disgusted by the fact that i learned c, c++ and jave for three years straight in that order only to find out after the ojt that noone in the industry needed my knowledge on it bcs they wanted me to have experience on the more advanced languages like python or even the web development stuff. so that sucks
What the fuck is this
wtf is that ending
Emojicode, exactly what I was looking for for career building.
Can I use Holy C on my Jaquards Loom?
never trust anything that constantly puts programming with god..... something culty is up.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pEfrdAtAmqk&amp;t=135">2:15</a> the way he shld raju from 3 idiots got me hard😂😂😂😂👌👌
what happened to perl?
hell yeah dude
Yeah ok time to quit this industry hahah, hilarious.
my anxiety level went high very fast
Im clearly lazy.
Learning 90% of those languages is a complete waste of time. Pick between C, C++, C#, Java or Javascript ecosystems, forget about everything else and you will do fine.
After watching this video, <br>Where do you see yourself in 5 years?<br>At a therapists office maybe
Can&#39;t believe i enjoy watching people talk 😌
This video is kinda like a DARE lesson. For some people it will push them away from drugs, for others it’s letting them expand their bucket list.
Hey guys. Don’t make it hard like this video. Just do it the easy way by being a natural born math genius like me. Then you don’t need to pick a specific language to learn, because you can naturally read and write all of them at a perfect level. 🥱😎
FOOLISH CHILD! CPP IS THE BEST LANGUAGE OF ALL TIME
I learn Java and Assembly.<br><br>Now that I see many people are having fun with making a programming language, I should make one for myself, but not for fun
Thanks for last 15 seconds of amygdala fuck! 😅
Dear world,<br>WHY THE HELL AREN&#39;T WE USING EMOJI CODE????
I think assembly is actually useful for troubleshooting reasons today
im in 12th grade, and we have 4 languages taught to us;  Visual Basic, HTML, C++ and Assembly 8085. Funfact, we are also taught logic gates and construction of binary program structures using transistors and other electronic components. if im not mistaken, the average cs college course only teaches you JS and/or .NET
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pEfrdAtAmqk&amp;t=35">0:35</a> FunFact : thats how our tears look like under a microscope💀
If you want to learn assembly and mashine code on a 4-16 Bit basis in a fun and easy way, I can recommend the game &quot;Turing Complete&quot; which makes you build a small computer from scratch and then teaches you to code directly with the hardware. Fun little thing to understand code in its simplest form on a hardware level.
I dont understandddddd
No love for Perl 😢
For those of you worried dont<br><br>Only like a fraction of these are actually used by more then 5 or 6 people, or a specific company.
bruh the ending 😭😂
I don&#39;t know if it is funny or sad to me that your iceberg missed about half the languages I have used professionally, and I have actually used almost half of the languages you did cover. <br><br>The number of languages developed for one-off scripting purposes before Lua became the standard solution is mind boggling. Then you also have the microcontroller specific languages that are higher level than assembly, but not fully compliant with any &quot;real&quot; language. Maybe those should be considered flavors of the language they are modeled after since they are usually a perfect sub-set of the real language&#39;s functionality, presumably because it started as an attempt to make a C compiler for the new architecture but only the parts needed by that initial team were ever implemented, or incomplete because the language chosen was wholly incompatible with the underlying tech (embedded java for 16 bit EMV cards).
This is quickly becoming my favorite YouTube channel.
wow
as an Indian, I like the deathbed picture you used
i hate how in india, the engineering colleges start teaching from the bottom, all the way up to top of the iceberg. also there is no programming taught before college.
I&#39;d like to add that the minimal amount of symbols needed for a turing-complete language is 6 (brainfuck has 8) and there is a language that has realized this beautiful obscenity
The last bit was iconic 😂
fantastico.
I remember Java. She was my first programming language. I hate that 6!tch to this day.
It’s important to realize that no one learns all these languages.
Every dev is talking about his 20 years of experience in programming. Me who  learned 2 languages their framework last 2 years and have created complex websites and apps but still know nothing rather than declaring variable
Matlab 📛
u have a pog daddy energy in u mate. ez subscribe

i learned dr racker, shit was so fucked, but i made couple of games w/it
and you still forgot lua :(
lol
Your channel&#39;s logo is very topical because I&#39;m hearing so many terms I&#39;m barely familiar with and that&#39;s what my brain is doing right now.

I love how thorough all this is and how well-organized it is.
Do the glorious Days of the mid-90s when I started my internet programming we&#39;re all I needed to know was Pearl and HTML. There was no CSS or JavaScript and even images were frowned upon. Those days were beautifully simple. Now I watch as Junior struggle to learn a fraction of what they need to know to do their jobs and I feel great pity for them. Of course even I have a hard time keeping up and I&#39;ve been doing this for over 25 years. Nowadays I just look forward to retiring so I can leave this rat race.
java<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>sucks so bad
The real chads never go above the water
My first language was c now leaning c++
Just wtf
so philosophy is the ultimate programming language, got it.
Where is WPILib?
hi
Most interesting, being a civil engineering watching CSE engineering full video
oh, func tion
deep
scriptware aka roblox exploit uses lua
I used elm for like 2 weeks in high school cause my teacher wanted us to play around with user interfaces and graphics and my god it was the absolute worst thing to try to learn. Everyone hated it so much that he just scrapped the elm assignment and never did it again in any of his courses
How can I learn rust as pro? Who can suggest any course many find good
What about PEGA? I knew someone who’s company was offering a 10k referral bonus if they could find someone who knew the language.
All you need is C# and SQL my friend. You don&#39;t need to speak 14 languages to write a book
You forget the dreamberd language
&quot;Any application that can be written in JavaScript, will eventually be written in JavaScript&quot;<br>Oh god. I wrote a software 3D engine in JavaScript. Not because it&#39;s useful, not because it&#39;s fast, not even because I&#39;m using it for anything, just because it could be done. Edit: Oh, it&#39;s also unreleased and will never be, lol.
I loved it!❤
man i just wanted a roadmap.....
Oh okay, so first I need to study philosophy. Thanks
I started programming with C++ and it&#39;s much more difficult than other languages. It&#39;s very mathematical. A language for true chads 🗿
Ever heard of mumps. A hospital had this program that was made for medical environment.
i got tired and lost after 30 seconds. Talking too fast.
WhyTF did I click this video while taking a break after learning how to program Hello World in Python?
I dove straight into C++ with a 4 hour course and using ChatGpt for additional insight. I could never imagine bullshitting myself by starting off with something like scratch even without ChatGpt
&quot;soy based languages&quot; is what I&#39;m gonna write in my CV now
Guys, I&#39;m only starting and have zero clue about anything (except some HTML); please help me know where to start.
Wrong. The best place to learn programming is K&amp;R.
I especially like the shout-out to COBOL. I took 2 semesters of it back in the day and I&#39;ve often thought there would be some serious money programming professionally in it (pun intended as it&#39;s used so much in banks).
I got Jebaited wtf, I thought u was gonna tell me what to learn to earn bruv
How can I give that much time to machine? Development means much more complex life. Finally understood one popular saying, Simplicity is Vaishnavism.
Back in uni they made us learn assembly for microcontrollers, imagine how amazed I was when the class following that the made us open python 😅
GLSL, CG, HLSL not included
Humans were made different
Meanwhile me that is stuck to what should I name my new project
where gdscript
Try politics, most unpleasant programming language of all.
Paradoxically, I think the more you know the more you become aware of all the things you don&#39;t know.
Makes me wanna shoot my computer and then rebuild it, while smiling.
I started at Java, and having had no real prior base it really sucked. This made me feel better that it was mentioned as a dumpster fire for beginners because for beginners, yes. Still hate Java tho
You put JSfuck in your chart but skipped it. I&#39;m triggered.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pEfrdAtAmqk&amp;t=279">4:39</a> Kotlin is actually Russian, it was done by a Russian team. Kotlin is an island near Sankt-Peterburg
loved the existential ending
From this day forward, I will pronounce SQL as &quot;Squeal&quot; every chance I get!
If I laughed I&#39;d loose content.....<br>Ended up fainting because I wanted to watch but laughing became too expensive.
I studied quantum electrodynamics but now I can’t correctly account for gravity? Where do I go from here
this fucked my brain up
I just found out that Go is developed by and at Google to replace C, at first I thought Go was to replace Java. Pascal is on the same level or category as C ? Because as I knew, Pascal can interact with Assembly which is a low level language. Pascal became a popular language before C was popular even though it was developed after C ? What still intrigues me to this day is how low-level languages like Assembly were developed ? Are you a developer ? If so, what is the programming language do you use ? You have broad knowledge of programming languages.
Awesome video i think the only one you could have added was regular expressions
Thank god AI is here to help people with Code learning
Thank you for scaring the shit outta me! Now I&#39;m gonna quit programming and maybe go to a mental asylum. 😀
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pEfrdAtAmqk&amp;t=735">12:15</a> WTF😂Gotta start being polite to machines in the face of AI uprising
It&#39;s funny that in my country&#39;s educational system, elementary students are first introduced to computer programming using Pascal language
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pEfrdAtAmqk&amp;t=136">2:16</a> , never thought I will be seeing Raju Rastogi here, totally unexpected
I like how even though it becomes deeply philosophical and puts me through an existential crisis, I can somehow always find a way to rely on JavaScript to help me out.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pEfrdAtAmqk&amp;t=920">15:20</a> that’s a bipolar transistor that isn’t used in processors, field effect transistors (MOS) are used instead.
I just heard of programming Bro Chill...
I QUIT!!!!!
i missing VBA
On what app or thing is he writing all of these languages on ?
After watching this I started remembering back like an afterlife that how many languages I actually know.
Zig is my favorite modern language. Not big on garbage collectors, plus I love the low-level and hate C macros. The way it deals with structs is kinda crazy though. Unless you define a constructor, a strict acts like a namespace. (I like this feature, since lack of namespacing makes C annoying as heck)
Did I just get a CS degree watching this?  Love the channel!! 😂😂😂
god help anyone trying to code from scratch !!!
You skipped VHDL and Verilog for soft hardware programming
the only programming thing that I know is the wiggle animation effect in after effects scripts
Oh my fucking god<br>As electronics engineer i had to learned compiler, logic gatter, machine code and how transistors work on a molecular level. <br><br>Pain<br><br>But funy to see that i startet from the bottom.
Brother, what you delivered might be good, but the picture u used of Jesus is so disrespectful!why?
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pEfrdAtAmqk&amp;t=467">7:47</a> i laughed here so hard.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pEfrdAtAmqk&amp;t=986">16:26</a><br><br>Apparently, intelligence is how effective you are at getting what you want.<br><br>Knowledge is the ability with which you are able to visualize the future.

We&#39;re all living in someone else&#39;s Ayahuasca trip.
When you started to talk about meme languages which seemed like a bonus content for the end of the video while there was no mention of stuff like assembly I started to question myself: are they not programming languages? Is it considered the realm of magic?
Holy C is the only language u need
Thank you, going for UPSC after this!
I skipped all the programming and went directly to the last one apparently.
Good one… thank you for sharing about programming languages
maybe ill better stay with scratch <a href="UCkszU2WH9gy1mb0dV-11UJg/NvgfY9aeC_OFvOMPkrOAsAM"></a> great video tho
the ending was so fucking real you have no idea. everything is connected. also where is visual basic? lol
Feels more like a &quot;No life&quot; road map =)
wonderful &#39;-)
I&#39;ve yet to see anyone produce an &quot;iceberg&quot; video of value.
Senior dev with graduate degree in computer engineering here; super great summary. The only issue is that the fractal iceberg needs a mario-style ascending beanstalk that leads to weird worlds such as &quot;Prompt Engineering&quot; and AGI
Alright I think I&#39;m just gonna learn English instead. IM OUTTA YR KTHXBYE
I am still upset that a fictional framework using only integers and while loops is not mentioned here. As this<br> is still Turing complete.
So many languages to communicate with computers 😢😢
WTF did I just watch?
this was so informative, and also funny af at the same time, thank you! 😄
I can use 2 Languages. Scratch and C and maybe C++
what did i just watch...
best video so far
no way man I really studying pascal in highschool
I was genuinely taken aback by the ending in the best way possible! It completely surprised me, but in a delightful and heartwarming manner.
python would normally be best to start someone off..  but most aim for webdev and in that line of work python isn&#39;t the place most can start.
lol the ending was so good!
I&#39;ll stick to python... thx
At the transistor level... you happen to show a diagram of a transistor with a Emitter base and collector. This is a BJT transistor and is generally not used for building computers. It is MOS tech with Source, G8 and drain... the rest seems fine tho :)
dudee stop stop STOOOOP
deep shit thx. worth my time
Did you just drop &quot;c is easy&quot; like that&#39;s not gunna cut the heart out of all us smooth brains ?😢
OH GOD WHAT DOES ANY OF THIS MEAN, IM IN PAIN MAN AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
І останній рівень - повна тиша ;)
I can&#39;t believe you let Rockstar out of it!!!
I wish I I could still wonder what php would be like
You need the roadmap?<br>Directly go to end no need to make it to the end...
Video Unclear , I quit my Developing Gig and now own a Cattle Farm.
Cool. Simple and brief explanation of computer programming history
It&#39;s cool that at the end of the video you recognize the essence of philosophy and metaphysics that analogically include computing and other topics that are essential to create hardware and software
I just lost all my interest in programming
What if I already solved epistemology what do I do next??!?!
My masters degree was in Physics and we learned Fortran as a part of our course. Probably because it is still a pretty fast language for implementing algorithms important for scientific computation, and also because it still has good support for a lot of scientific equipment and instruments, including older instruments. I don&#39;t think it is used in any sort of consumer-end technology anymore.
shitpost
Thank you kind sir, with this knowledge now I can skip all of those programming languages and tap straight into my genetic code so I can run programs directly on my body for maximum efficiency and zero delay.
I have been trying to figure out what the FUCK that .apl file is saying but I am an ant attempting to translate ancient Marsan
But do you know ue5 blueprints?
oh, man! It blew my mind
World is just expansion of our minds.. from Hindu Scriptures😶‍🌫
you have demotivated people like me really well,,,,,,🤣🤣🤣
Did I just hear that there is now a superset of C++, which is of course a superset of C, made by Google, called Carbon?
i dissapointed that you have missed Perl - this is one of pillars of programming languages
useless vid
Aren&#39;t html and css a form of markdown?
Repent, sinner- Heil GOD
I love the content and how informative and accurate it is. But I think the video title is quite misleading. Initially I clicked because I wanted to know what I need to learn in order to become a good developer. Thought the title could have been &quot;Programming Languages Iceberg Explained&quot; or something.
&quot;Lua is easier and faster than python&quot; <b>*Python fans proceeds to attempt cancel this channel*</b>
Lol java was my first programming language
I think You forgot:<br>- Forth - has a niche in astronomical and space applications but... may BIOSes had forth interpreters and internally coded in forth; <br>- perl - camel is present on iceberg, but You didn&#39;t mentioned it - very important language.
This video started with sanity and descended into madness at the end o.o
my college is literally teaching us assembly in the first semester
this is incredible. i love learning about all these languages even the meme type languages. all the way down to the assembly and binary language. its so interesting i want to learn them all! i&#39;ll stick to python for now though
many people think you can get job if you know 1 language but it&#39;s completely bs. I haven&#39;t seen any company who hires anyone as developer if he only knows 1 or 2 languages. You may know java, c# or python but there are so many other stuff they require. Most of time, for java developer position, they require you to know spring framework, sql as well as react or angular + clouding technology like aws or azure and docker, jackins and system designing skills etc etc. It&#39;s so frustrating that you have to know so much to get developer jobs. :(
I&#39;m screwed....
LISP is interesting, because CAD functions still rely heavily on modified LISP programs. I code primarily in LISP because I&#39;m a draftsman and I use it to draw plans.
new programmer what to learn?
One question on ChatGPT can save time
Raju from 3 idiots on death bed meme😂
Poor LabView, doesn&#39;t even get mentioned
Well that escalated quickly
functionnal programming langage should have been a wayyyy lower xD
pic of raju 🤣🤣🤣🤣
Fortran, 4Chan. NOOOOOOO!@@@!!!
&gt; chad c++ allows other soy languages like java to be written<br>or something like that, which made me laugh
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pEfrdAtAmqk&amp;t=28">0:28</a> Thanks, I just klicked the video because the languages on the bottom of the iceberg felt still not too exotic/unknown.
You forgot to mention chemical programming like DNA/RNA and social engineering.
Me, a Fortran lover-&gt; 😢
No
To be or not to be
So i started from working with C++ where we were given leetcode style problems to solve in my university and then learned a little bit of Java through Android Studio and currently i work with JavaScript and React making my journey opposite to what it should&#39;ve been 😂
No delphi?
You don&#39;t have Java listed, I unsubscribe from your channel!
Kudos for Holy C and its creator Terry Devis - The smartest programmer that had ever lived
FORTH
Are you like.. placing meta ads on your videos ? 😂
Where the FK is GLSL?!?!?! WHeRe THAHHH FKKKK ISSS GLLLLSSSSSLLLLL?!!?!?  GLSL PLEB!
Nice video. I missed one that I used allot, Forth. A stack oriented, reverse polish, concatenated language.
I tried to learn Python first, but I gave up. First programming language I learned was C++. I still find it easier than Python to this day. Maybe I&#39;m just weird. . .
Surprised you didn&#39;t include Perl
Are there any other assembly 8086 programmers here with me?
I think you forgot such an important language as Rockstar. The ultimate goal of every 10x developer.
Fun fact: games such as Pokemon red and blue were written in Assembly
No way! not sure where you get your data from. C, C++, Java/JavaScript, Python are the very top of programming for any SERIOUS developer. Rust, Go, etc. are more application/platform specific languages which come and go. C/C++ is most valuable, web technologies follow with higher level languages like JS after, PHP etc.
no powerbuilder nooooo
im so scared rn
I hate Scratch
OMG! You just degraded me from a point where i already thought no coding youtubers create a app/script/ui
none of them satisfy me. Guess I&#39;m on my way to make my own one
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pEfrdAtAmqk&amp;t=970">16:10</a> lmaoooo
HTML is a markup language not a programming language. It&#39;s in its name.
chad devs listen up
Can&#39;t help but notice that Minecraft Redstone didn&#39;t make the list. What gives?
there&#39;s so much to know... now that i&#39;ve learned a good amount of html, css, javascript, and python, I feel like learning C (if its actually easy to learn as they say) may be valuable to get an understanding of how some of these higher-level languages are constructed.<br><br>edit: also, &quot;always bet on JS, you&#39;ll never lose&quot; feels like good advice tbh
Lol, I&#39;ve at least some experience in most of the tiers and while professionally I use more of the the higher tiers on my spare time I descent to the dungeons of programming with logic gates and machine code
TempleOS and HolyC are ultimate God-tier.
colleges teaching C in 1st sem: Allow us to introduce ourselves
Down in the second lowest tier you will find languages designed for radiation hardened processors used in satellites. So obscure and rare the language dies with the inventor.
future developers here, if you are stressed come meditate with me!❤
Your lack of Z80 ASM is pretty lame as well.
Ok, but where is redstone?
There is a dangerous myth in there. By devising a functional quantum computer (or anything really very special that is already coveted) most probably you won’t be rich. Someone else with the appropriate credentials, means and “right place” will steal it. Perhaps you’ll get something good out of it or perhaps you’ll end dead. But that is the real world we live in.
Ah yes, my favourite programming language: TRANSISTORS
Haven&#39;t even finished the video but you get a thumbs up for that category theory reference
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pEfrdAtAmqk&amp;t=137">2:17</a> Meme is from Bollywood hit &quot;3 idiots&quot;
My first language was C++... regret it immensly... but at least it&#39;s a fun language 🙂
i am confused, is learning python and planning on learning HTML after not enough to do anything?
Which language will give best return for freshers  ? As a bignner i know c, java , python with sql and a bit of html css and javascript.<br>Also which old language I should learn for better pay in the industry?
LUA is the inbred child of Python and scratch.
I can program in Python, Java, C, C++, and a few types of Assembly<br><br>I cannot find a programming job.<br>(Not given up yet tho)
“Java is a dumpster fire for beginners”<br>Idk man 12 year old me had a pretty good grip of it messing around with runescape private servers… learning c++ and unreal engine now and boy I thought the old Java skills would help a lot more
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pEfrdAtAmqk&amp;t=576">09:36</a>  &quot;to scale it up to the monstrosity that is today&quot; KEKW ROLFMAO
I started crying around 4 minutes in.
Lmao I genuinely study Epistemology 💀
why are these videos talking at 200 words a second ?
I love you
you left out microcode! =)
Meh , dude,  u missed Verilog and VHDL
Please be serious... You put CSS HTML PHP Lua R SQL and Ruby in a lower rank than JS and Python, they should have be in the same rank...
and then the swiss decided to call it brainf**k
I usually work with python and javascript (+ whatever framework is the hype flavor of the day right now) but I want to learn a final 3rd language as well.<br>I dabbled in C# before but I don&#39;t like being married to microsoft so that&#39;s a no go. <br>Java is an obvious alternative but maybe it&#39;s all a bit too high level for me.<br>C and C++ seem like obvious choices but it feels like average guys like me would just waste their time as we&#39;re never gonna make anything of actual use with those languages.<br>So the only remaining choice is assembler, obviously.
As a computer science student I confirm it&#39;s not that complex. I mean it is complex but not this complex.
Personally I would never choose scratch over a node-based system like the one in UE Blueprint or Blender. The node programming is so much more accessible and controllable, especially with the folders and connections. Not to mention every node is like a card where you can read its stats while scratch is more like a sentence which is an absolute pain to make math expressions with.
I&#39;m in web dev since 2003. And I can clearly state that HTML and CSS are not even close to programming languages. They are the contents and visual representation. Just google the abbreviation, it&#39;s self explanatory. Move over. JavaScript is not programming language either. Just as it states. JS is scripting language. So does Phyton and PHP.
Mind blown! <a href="UCkszU2WH9gy1mb0dV-11UJg/LsMfY8P6G-yckNAPjoWA8AI"></a>
Disappointed the Turing Complete programming language LaTeX was not mentionned
I started with Python, then C++, then Verilog and System Verilog, and now Assembly. (Im in EE) I&#39;ve liked each language more than the last UNTIL assembly... I just dont get it and I hate how it is assembler-specific
gwat damn
Me: does my academic research in R, bash, C++, and SQL<br>Also Me: Makes a horrendously big to learn list based on this iceberg to actually communicate the science.
COBOL, my beloved
What about VHDL and Verilog!
If you wanna feel like an idiot, remember RCT2 was written in assembly.
Rust isn&#39;t a programming language. It&#39;s a language for morons.
you can tell the people that created the names for these languages have lost their sanity. the names have no rhyme or reason…
Holy C! 😂
I like c#, except when I open an old project and visual studio says 264 in red

I think this is the best video of yours and I love to watch it over and over
Very delightful video mmmm yummm
a Cable Guy fan I see 🙃
This Video answered many of questions i never asked out loud, but left me with more question than i could ever possible ask!
Why did you have to end with that existential crisis stuff man..😂
Great video, but was the existential crisis at the end really necessary??
Can someone help explain what all these terms are? object oriented, garbage collector? static type (what does that even mean) and so on?? I love coding and do a lot of html, css, swift and python, and am trying to expand to some terminal coding and possibly c++/c, but what on earth are all these terms, and where do people go to pick up all this knowledge? YouTube is great but seems kind of inefficient when it comes to this kind of stuff
The programming languages I know are Basic, JavaScript, and C++. Good enough for my projects and jobs as electrical engineer. May learn python too but that will be my last programming language
I solved it in exam😁<br>BTW love your videos
🤔
what am I?
The 2 best programming languages are Ti-Basic and HP49G programming. No one I know has made any improvements to either into a more advanced language
Nobody can be in any way comparable to God. Please change the title.
I&#39;m a senior majoring in Cyber sec... I downloaded pycharm once and made it print hello world... I barely understood half of the vocabulary in this video and now I&#39;m terrified.
Oh, it appears Delphi doesn&#39;t exist in your reality 😮
The awesome roadmap aside, are you secretly John Mulaney the comedian? Been listening to him quite a bit recently and I gotta say you sound identical to him if only calmer. 🤔
Rust is like The Wire of programming languages. It&#39;s fairly solid, but people who use it literally cannot stop talking about it and will always try to peer pressure you into switching to it at any moment programming gets brought up.<br><br>If its community goes too much further and it&#39;ll end up getting the title of the &quot;Rick and Morty&quot; of programming languages.
Bro you didn&#39;t even mention Delphi/Pascal
Bro is literally teaching CS, philosophy  and maths
And why leave out the Chadest of the Chad: Hand weaving wires as code in the Apollo flight computers?
Why leave out WASM?
I watched until end. Where is visual basic?
I can&#39;t even believe that there is a programming language called BRAINF**K
This video is AMAZING when I&#39;m high. 🤯🤯🤯
Very interesting to me ngl.<br><br>It&#39;s stressful rn and I&#39;m just learning C++, but I&#39;m still hanging on lmao.
No love for sml 😔
I can write the word hELL0 upside down on my calculator
funny that the first programming language i learned is java
So I shouldn&#39;t have started with C++ ? 😂💀
Who writes in Binary?
Started programming in Java since 1997 and started understanding how to do object modeling using Peter Coad&#39;s approach also around that time. After over 10 years of extensive prpgramming in Java, its stuck in my head even when helping my junior programmers debugging code in non Java. After over 10 years of thinking in Object Models, its stuck in my head even for non IT work. The plus side is that it helps me learn new stuff fairly complete albiet a bit slower due to needing to identify the important domains of the new area / subject.<br>I find object modeling and Java to be fairly easy and allows my small team  of 2 programmers to maximise code and data reuse. With over 30 systems developed since 2008 with seamless data integration and business rules reused, new systems developed typically reused plenty of existing components.
am i the only one who climbed it from bottom?
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pEfrdAtAmqk&amp;t=592">9:52</a> this is not correct. The first high level programming language was Plankalkül (1948), designed by German engineer Konrad Zuse.
That was perfect...<br>I was going to be mad if you didn&#39;t mention assembly....but then you mentioned it, transistors, and epistemology... and I loved it.
Funny how all Vietnamese students first language is FPC, which is free verson of Pascal. Some hardcore took Asembly. We litterally begin our program career from the botton of the ice berg
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pEfrdAtAmqk&amp;t=690">11:30</a> HAHAHA
2006-2010 eastern eu country still uses pascal to teach code for highschool :D :D :D
FORTRAN 77 is still used....
<i>How are HTML &amp;&amp; CSS, below Python &amp;&amp; JS</i> ?
I wonder why you go to level of transistors and logic gate but do not mention HDL, Verilog, Spinal HDL, and the like.
you gone  chip  system that far but forgot math u_u..!!
love this video
I&#39;m now Brainf*** certified developer.
bäm
mentions PIET yet ignores LabVIEW...
I &lt;3 BRAIN FUCK
I found you today and I already love you
i love how despite this iceberg being commonly agreed on my school insists that the mandatory introduction to computer science class teach only drracket and netlogo (python java and such forth are for later cs courses after intro to cs)
So, start with Quantum Electrodynamics, got it. Thanks!
Lol
perl, awk or bash?
bro i studied in highschool Pascal, and that was 8 yrs ago. isnt that stupid ? xDDDDDD
Me programming my calculator in machine code: Wait, I&#39;m still not deep enough in the iceberg.
so if i summarize , we went from scratch to quantum physics for then to speak of philosophy. NEAT
i didnt even know that python was made by my own country! (netherlands)
learning
learned
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pEfrdAtAmqk&amp;t=592">9:52</a> I knew something was off about my university. Even furthermore, they expect us to debug fortran on paper
Calling SQL &quot;squeal&quot; from now on and waiting to see what my coworkers think or if they even notice
Wow I knew there were a lot of programming languages but this is insane. So many new ones too. Really overwhelming!
the ending of this video is amazing. pure storytelling.
The reality is knowledge is power, until you alter your state of consciousness and consequently forget what you thought you knew.
I have been stuck on that last level since college man
I like the part when you talk about javascript with that meme song!!
Rust is absolute trash. Why did I allow myself to get fooled into learning this failure of a language?
Bro i just wanted to learn python
Amazing video. Learned C and ASSEMBLY on my electrical engineering grad. Now I only use Python 🙂
<a href="UCkszU2WH9gy1mb0dV-11UJg/xsIfY4OqCd2T29sP54iAsAw"></a>
Am I going down the iceberg or is the iceberg going up me?
<b>me using gdev</b> huh, looks like i dont exsist
Is it normal that I&#39;m sweating watching this video as a junior web developer?
That’s so amazing..<br><br>Infant my kids o watch it in 20 yrs
Did not understand shit but oddly find myself wanting to torture myself with learning a language. Any recommendations?
You only need html, css, js, php, sql and a good idea to  became rich.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pEfrdAtAmqk&amp;t=33">0:33</a> love the sarcasm in these videos
@<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pEfrdAtAmqk&amp;t=410">6:50</a> What the hell did he say? &quot;...compilers that make all the other ???-based languages possible.&quot;
u do assembly in 1. semester
I did not think Haxe was represented more in depth, in resume:<br><br>Haxe is an OOP language transitioning to multiparadigm that compiles to JS/C++/JAVA/PY/PHP/C#/LUA code, JVM/SWF bytecode and has two virtual machines, the predecessor NekoVM and the successor Hashlink, the language is primarily focused on making games with heaps, OpenFL among other engines and it can be used by any engine like Unity.
The Only thing I know is NOTHING
Lolcode actually made me lol
What about hardware design languages like Verilog 😢
how much time will it take to master all of these languages?
compiling programs written in GO sucks if you don&#39;t feel like learning GO
What monstrosity of a video
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pEfrdAtAmqk&amp;t=313">5:13</a> &quot;Most people afraid to going deeper&quot; as an embedded coder I&#39;m afraid to going upper. C? Assembly? Most logical best languages for me. Need something too easy? C# And C++ Helps.
I don&#39;t want to be a dick, but this is pretty frustrating to see.<br><br>PROLOG is declarative (excluding the &quot;cut&quot;), and specific to expert systems. SQL is similar, but for databases. They are both so high-level as to not be useful for generic coding -- they should be at the top, or left out.<br><br>Along those lines, HTML isn&#39;t even a programming language.<br><br>BASIC was high-level for its day, but conventional BASIC code uses line numbers &amp; jumps for control flow. Instead of variable scope and proper functions you get memory address literals. It&#39;s arguably more like machine language than most of the others.<br><br>Why is Ruby below Python &amp; JS? They&#39;re all roughly the same in terms of expressiveness, but if we&#39;re going to force a distinction, Ruby is higher-level. It has a superset of the others&#39; features, a much better story about FP, proper message passing, easier metaprogramming, easy eDSLs, and more. JS didn&#39;t even have classes until a few years ago.<br><br>And speaking of Lisps... Python&#39;s &quot;lambdas&quot; were intentionally hobbled, which has a huge impact on expressivity. Anything with proper lexical closure should go above it, including Common Lisp.<br><br>Why is TS lower than JS -- the type checker? Why are all of the languages that allow currying down near C? Good lord, why any of this?
Scratch is definitely easy.  I created an rpg battle engine in an hour.
Why did you miss Dr. Racket and Perl 😭 they are the best.........,......
I know nothing, thanks to you.
I can program in nandgame asm. What tier is that?
I think you have forgotten verilog and VHDL (hardware descriptive languages)
Not a bad little effort... shame you stopped short of Ontology... although you got a &#39;god mode&#39; in there so... cool_thnx - my cat approves! :D
Most pathetic video on the internet I must say
I recommend everyone stop watching after <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pEfrdAtAmqk&amp;t=325">5:25</a>
So… that was a trip
Didn&#39;t expect to see Ada!<br><br>Personally I like to use Java, C, and AMD64 assembly (Intel syntax, through NASM) the most.<br><br>It&#39;s funny as someone who actually programs in assembly that everyone still calls assembly on modern x86 based CPUs x86 assembly, when in reality pretty much every 64 bit CPU uses an AMD64 instruction set, and good luck running an X86 program on that when all your syscalls do an INT 0x80 instead of the SYSCALL instruction.
Bro missed out on Verilog :(
Nice scripting, especially towards the end.
MIND. BLOWN.
4 minutes in and I&#39;m already stressed
If you ever do something like this again you should include forth (which is nice and actually used) and postscipt
Many (if not all) languages can be multi platform provided they’re available on a platform
No one worth listening to pronounces SQL as squeal.
HTML is NOT a programming language, it’s a data notation/symbology.
I quit at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pEfrdAtAmqk&amp;t=566">9:26</a> can&#39;t take it anymore
Am I the only one who heard a female voice in the background sometimes?
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pEfrdAtAmqk&amp;t=965">16:05</a> is said in vedas lol
Im surprised he didn&#39;t mention anything about Industrial programming languages like Ladder, Structured text, or at least SCL. Almost all industrial devices worldwide are running on one of these languages.
I only like strongly typed languages. They seem harder to learn but as soon as you try something like python after C# you really miss it.
I was looking through the top comments expecting a &quot;we all miss Terry&quot;. Here you go.
You missed matlab😂😂
Yeah, If you want to explode you brain, no C,C++ or any high level language, just use assembly language.    Most sane people do not use this.
I&#39;m sorry, could you repeat that.
Only God can create life clown. Use that term for the only one who deserves it.
am i the only one that absolutely hates scratch? i was first introduced to it when i did cs50 a while back and i found it more difficult than the c i learnt there idk i may just be dumb but thats the worst thing i ever learnt
Ewww JS
I know nothing, would using a lesser used language with your website make it harder to hack? For instance SQL injection not working due to the languages being different?
there is one more level down, the Turing Machine which although isn&#39;t really coded but built it can do everything possible with a computer
Please make an epistemology  video.
Need a tutorial to print Hello World in Quantum Electrodynamics!!!
Ford interceptors
Keep intercepting money
Keep intercepting people
Come on man just intercept that money
If we lived in Zuckerberg&#39;s metaverse then how would we hate him so much?
Myspace was trying to teach us all how to use html 😭
.. so just learn rust?
Just write haskell and then give up and write python and javascript.
Is there a reason pascal is lower than c++?
&quot;You would be surprised to see what you can do with scratch&quot; <b>Makes a bad Scratch game</b> Me meanwhile: Ohhh yeah heck boy here we go Scratch servers and a appstore game lessgooo
Amazing ending
Saving this video for anytime i become too comfortable as software engineer so i can question my abilities and study harder.
I started with 68000 assembly back in the Amiga days, then x86 assembly, then high level languages like Pascal, &#39;C&#39;, and C++, which all seemed so easy after years of assembly language. My favourite language is good old-fashioned Ansi &#39;C&#39; followed by 68000 asm. My least favourite languages are Objective-C and MIPS asm.
Meanwhile me, who stareted with C++ and enjoys it:
Python+Flask is above all...Better than PHP, better than JS, better than My SQL
if Anders Hejlsberg touched it, it&#39;s gold!
The shuttle background noise coming up from time to time drove me nuts!<br>Cool recap otherwise
Come on man I still program in pascal as my main language
Where did my recommendation page  took me to?
thought i was smart until you told me c++ ain&#39;t the shit
Great video! Tho I would have also added a dedicated layer for hardware description languages (basically circuit designs), programming FPGAs with hardware languages like VHDL, Verilog and SystemVerilog these are the languages you use to design CPUs and ICs, to design the transistor placements (oversimplifying a lot here), these are the ones used by companies (not facts as I don’t think it’s stated anywhere officially, this is just an educated guess that is quite likely) like Intel, AMD and othes to make the actual processors that run your machine code! (the thing that gets compiled from your assembly for anyone wondering). You can read more here if intrested: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hardware_description_language">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hardware_description_language</a>
Catch a breath Man! This was so hard to understand at that speed as to render it as a zero.
You forgot MatLab (+ Stateflow- state graph ) and DirectX (+ HLSL - shader language).
gooda vi de o
Haskell code is pretty satisfying to write once you get the hang of it 😊
Spoiler: the end devolves into an existential crisis without warning. Do not watch while high.
The end though🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
wow
This is a god-tier YT channel, coding or not.
&quot;web development&quot;, then shows chrome. Yuck.
any HDL language?
Do a video on Perl
That expansion for Basic is very likely a backronym.
mfer....thx for vid xD
My man forgot about Holy C
I settled down on Typescript and Rust 3 years ago with some Dart for mobile.
I was so confused between c++ or Java <br>BUT NOW thanks to you i convert ac current from electronic wire to DC current while closing and opening circuits to receive a fully functional binary code on my television screen.... I have practically became an alternative to transistors or even electricity itself
So glad I started with Java and C as my first programming languages, not necessarily I was forced into it or I had no choice, In a way I love how hard it was, it paid off though I could just look at php or javascript and can quickly adapt to the language with little to no effort
when he said god tier roadmap, he literally meant it!
Wow, Raju made into the video.  I do request everyone watch the movie &quot;3 Idiots&quot;.
Absolutely brilliant!
Java is Canadian
I techincally started with Batch and Html (some javascript) in hs, but that was over a decade ago.<br><br>To jump back in.. I started with C and soon assembly.<br><br>I also.. did follow that rabbit trail into the quantum.<br>I started learning electronics and programming at the same time.
I went top to bottom to middle
real programmers code with millions of dip switches in binary
My eyes have been opened. Please make a video on god-tier map for PYTHON,  which will include how to do everything with PYTHON or related to PYTHON.
so in the end all comes down to epistemology
Very impressed that my father knows C++ inside and out, who uses it for signal processing and electronic engineering. Im an electrochemist and have no clue about any form of programming, wish I did though
Thank you for this, I&#39;m gonna switch degrees.
what a misleading title
I took a class named &quot;Languages&quot; where I had to do small projects in every main coding paradigm. So for example, I had to code connect-4 (the game) in Racket, with a greedy algorithm to play against, and since we were focusing in the functional paradigm, we weren&#39;t allowed to use &quot;let&quot;, &quot;map&quot; or &quot;define&quot; to store variables since that is not entirely functional. To make it worse, you only have two weeks to do this projects 🥴
And you didn&#39;t said that some logic gates are activated with electric charge and others are activated with lack. Just to be consistent 😂
And Pascal was my first 😊
After 5th it&#39;s a lot easier 😉
👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏 outstanding content thank you
That ending was perfect lmao.
man @<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pEfrdAtAmqk&amp;t=940">15:40</a> you spooked me with the kids in the background, mine are out of the house... damn<br>but also great video ! :-)
Maybe you are alright I guess
you forgot batch and VBscript which I use daily xD
awesome shit... =)
You know, I think I might go learn zig ... No reason for it, just ... Feel a connection to it.
I wanna learn the Chef programming language
bro has an existential crisis at the end :(
i don&#39;t write the code, the code writes me
you lost me at brain fuck
wtf 🤯
It&#39;s been a long time since i see a so fking funny and really good video
I like how you always mention something about psychedelic trips :)
Where is delphi?😭
HTML is not a programming language. It&#39;s an exercise in frustration.
This video has very little to do with anything I do on a daily basis as a lifelong software engineer..
&quot;What is knowledge&quot;
yeah, should&#39;ve just gotten my forklift license instead
That ending was really fun for me. XD 🤣<br>Good info as to the rest. Thanks!
I know it seems too difficult, but to understand the basics it isn&#39;t, it&#39;s like 6 college courses.
You forgot one language. It&#39;s DNA. It&#39;s a language living things are made of.
I need to master transistors. I have an idea that will blow everyone&#39;s mind so I will keep it to my self until I learn and implement transistors logic.
I have no idea how such a good YouTuber like you can still make the beep unacceptably loud, didn&#39;t you watch it back to check if it&#39;s volume fits with the rest of the video?
Obviously brainfuck is the best programming language
tbh I don&#39;t really know which is more nightmare fuel for a beginner coder: an esoteric language that is useless (so you won&#39;t need to learn it) or assembly (that is a must, yet more concise)
Holy shit, the end escalated quickly.
Ah mi mente 🫨😵‍💫
Writing code?<br>Nah, I&#39;ll just ask the AI to do it.
Missing C# and Visual Basic
we can make a raycaster, raymarcher, 3d engine, raytracing, pathtracer, etc on scratch
Appreciate the detail you went in to create this video
I like SaS.
this is the best video about programming so far especially the end!
I only vaugely know C# because of Unity
I was accepted as an intern in a High end company, all their low end programming was written in a modified version of C. I wanted to commit die.
As a software Engineer, you lost me at Java 😅
bro wtf...IM IN
C misses a buildin easy and safe string type and using null as terminator makes it uhm unsafe and inflexible. Don&#39;t mix data and logic. <br><br>C++ is just the most terrible language which just throws all paradigm together and has no coherence and somehow is popular because programmers like being godlike important and obnoxious for others 😅.  <br><br>All the modern alternatives miss the eco system and integrated development experience. Code completion, refactoring, interactive debugging, a GUI framework, designer, ...<br><br>Web dev is another hell. Framework on framework on framework and every few years another one pops up and its just all stacked and wired/patched up and non visual for a visual end experience. <br><br>What happened to the streamlined experiences of the &#39;90s? Visual Basic, Delphi.
The information was well organized, great video!
the end...
Missed opportunity to mention VHDL and Verilog...
As the video loaded I thought &quot;huh, 175k likes wonder why that is&quot; and by the end I knew.  Take 175k+1 my friend.
You’re literally my favorite human
You missed microcode between assembly and transistors.<br><br>Most, though maybe not all, epistemologists would say that knowledge is justified true belief, Gettier cases notwithstanding.
Kotlin is the name of the island in Baltic Sea near Saint Petersburg and also before the war Jetbrains have had most of developer force (including Kotlin creators themselves) in Saint Petersburg. So I think it is more Russian than Czech
Most of us started with Assembly.
That was a very climactic and rewarding end. I feel very satisfied that you brought up epistemology. I have no idea what anything in this video was explaining, as a layperson, but I enjoyed it regardless. Especially the climax at the end about the Matrix and Brain in a Vat.
😅😂😂
Object Pascal is very used for build medium and small ERP&#39;s in Brazil. <br>Delphi and Lazarus are the IDE&#39;s used for coding with it.
Temple OS, an operating system written under the direction of God
Learning to code myself tonight
🙂
Notably absent from this discussion: Objective-C.
Fun fact: you&#39;re pronouncing &quot;Piet&quot; wrong. It&#39;s actually the Dutch version of &quot;Pete&quot; and pronounced (almost) the same way
C and C++ that&#39;s my start
I love that Matlab is not on that list
I&#39;ve never wanted someone to stop talking so bad (no offense)
Lmao, fuck JS
I literally said &quot;shut the brain f**k up&quot; by the end. You speak so much!
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pEfrdAtAmqk&amp;t=127">2:07</a>
Funnily i learned to code with Assembly and C (yea my teacher was the devil). Then we had a good laugh at VB and learned C++. I thought JS, TS, PHP, HTMLK and CSS myself, as they seemed kinda useful. SQL was also learned somewhere in that period. Somehow got into game design with Unity and learned C#.<br><br>Now I am a fullstack Webdev. TS, C# and SQL are my bread and butter. So in my professional live I am as far detached from hardware as it gets.<br><br>Yet, I love tinkering with rpis &amp; arduinos and lately found a &quot;game&quot; simply called &quot;Tuiring complete&quot;. Your objective is to build a fully turing complete computer out of nand-gates.<br><br>I might be the definition of a geek, but I swear I have seen a woman lately. Or was it just a dream? Dammit!
Awesome video.
my man you just caused my confidence to dip! looking for c++ it was in the middle noooooooooooooo
man, I&#39;m now co-de-pressed
I&#39;m starting to feel you were high doing this vid
watching this video is exactly what programming in brain f**k feels like, approved.
so which is used for programing nuclear missiles??
I made a programming language called Strike I hope to publish it nearly
I only have issue with explanation of the lowest level. AFAIK there is not difference between ASM and machine code. When I started out in 2008 we learned C first with ASM integration (High school, year 1). ASM being specific to a certain architecture came pretty much with documentation regarding said infrastructure and with clear mapping of ASM commands to machine code. So ASM keywords were pretty much just numbers really just in ASCII representation. Further in documentation there was a circuit diagram so that you could translate those commands directly into &quot;logic gates and wiring diagram&quot;. <br><br>Point was that for every program you wrote, you could calculate EXACTLY how many clock cycles it is going to take, know EXACTLY how the machine state looks in for every clock cycle and where, how and how long the data will be there. And yes I am taking into account memory refresh every X cycles to preserve data stored in it. You could (and one group did) build your own computer from scratch. Soldering and all.
I spit out my beverage at Shitcoin
What about PowerPoint
TBH In the last tier I would include VHDL/Verilog as languages in which you can program a processor onto a FPGA chip, so it would landd between machine code and transistors.
The best video for demotivating anyone that wants to learn how to program😂😂😂😂
“Become a programmer”, haha.  ChatGPT must have come out the day after this was uploaded
Me as a beginner who doesn&#39;t know how to code at all what should I learn first to build websites<br>- HTML<br>- CSS<br>- Javascript
So in conclusion:<br>Everything can tickle your brain<br>And that&#39;s good
Did you actually forgot ruspython
You forgot programming the mind and body through the central nervous system by using acupuncture, pressure points and at higher levels artificial biological nanocircuits connected to a modified webtv server which is programmed in arachnid assembly language that can only be accessed and modified from the ISS by one astronaut, one cosmonaut and a chinchilla with ticks.  Some Ayurvedic practitioners claim to have breached the server but this has never been proven.
i need to lie down
I actually have the &quot;Programming the Z-80&quot; book. 😅
Forgot excel, start all again
this === quality
I am surprised that you didn&#39;t mention BhaaiLang, which was developed in Covid-19 pandemic inspired by Indian Superstar Salman Khan! 😂
...or you could just study programming at a university. Real easy to get a job as junior dev when you&#39;re done.
❤❤❤❤
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pEfrdAtAmqk&amp;t=69">1:09</a> my brother in christ i have   like at most 5 years scrath programming experience, and think java is easy<br>You ahve no idea how hard it is<br>Also, griffpatch is god<br>No joking, theres just too much evidence<br>Green blocks suck btw, he should stop using them.<br>Stupid order of operations in scrath, why u no pemdas
html is a markup language, it&#39;s in the name.😂
Chef is a popular automation tool featured on the Cisco DevNet certification
You missed microcode and  VHDL.
Hell of a video - 10/10.  I don&#39;t know myself anymore.
I loved the vid, but I&#39;m sad that you left out the three main languages for programing PLCs (Programmable Logic Controller), these being SCL, LAD, and FBD. The first is text based similar to python I guess (I have never used python so I&#39;m not sure), but the other two are pictogram based. Check the out sometime, they are used very often when working with automation in factory settings.
Thanks now I&#39;m in my existential crisis mode😂
The moment my brain started to understand lolcode i knew i was spiraling into insanity
I done goofed up and learned C as my first language which was a real kick in the groin but after learning it, stuff like C++, C#, JavaScript, and SQL where a lot easier to learn. I still revert to C/C++ for fleshing out ideas or solutions to tricky problems when I can. Sure I might not be able to include classes in my experimental solutions but a struct and some functions can yield a pretty clear answer that I can reproduce in higher level languages using OOP. Luckily my actual job uses a C++ derivative, AngelScript, so it worked out pretty well so far. Excellent break down and history of coding languages.
when talking about gates i would mention VHDL , HDL, Verilog so the nightmare of programming students, and a scourage to programming langauges
Wow, Cobol. My dad was a Cobol programmer for moat of his career, and it came out the year after he was born. That&#39;s an impressive lifespan
&quot;I&#39;m a programmer.&quot;<br>&quot;Cool, what language?&quot;<br>&quot;Epistemology&quot;<br>&quot;I haven&#39;t heard of that. What is it?&quot;<br>&quot;I don&#39;t know. No one knows.&quot;
The sad thing is the instability. You’re under a constant threat of losing your job .
The Transistor one got me.
yoo we show haxe

FireShip: Java and C++ are both impossibly difficult for beginners   <br><br>Me who just want to code mods for minecraft :(
idk if you&#39;ve seen xlogicx&#39;s fantastic 2015 defcon talk, but i would strongly suggest skipping assembly and learning bytecode directly if you want to go low level. assembly is too high level. in fact skip hex notation entirely as well and just program in 1s and 0s. that&#39;s what got humans to the moon after all
Well, the genetic code is a programming language 😂
University started me with java and I&#39;m sure it&#39;s why I stopped comp sci. If they&#39;d started me on python, JS or C# my life would be entirely different.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pEfrdAtAmqk&amp;t=170">2:50</a> but HTML is not a programming language
I’m a freshman now, apparently in a year I’m gonna have to learn how to do assembly code, god help me.
As a scala dev I’m pretty sad you spent about 2 seconds talking about the best language :(
This guys f*cks!!....🔥
Having just started learning python, I must say, it’s been fun coming to the realization that even writing 10 lines of a working function from scratch can take like 2 hours if you aren’t a senior coder(or using chat gpt).
I&#39;m fairly certain I won&#39;t regret not learning PHP on my deathbed.
pascal was my first programming language i learned it in highschool<br>in 2016 xD <br>they switched to python but some schools still use pascal because teachers are too old to learn another programming language so in the national exam we have two prog exams one for python and the other for pascal
2025?! But currently is 2023!
Dont wanna be on my deathbed wondering if i shouldve tried php ;)
What language do geospatial programmers use?  And what about people who do complex data analytics graphics?
Bro somehow in Vietnam few years ago we have to study Pascal in high school for no reason, thankfully they changed it to Python
Ur def still in that trip from 10 years ago
Real programming pros use sand++.
I nominate bhai lang for the last tier
Assembly ❤
people who make minecraft mods are familiar with java
I have chosen Holy C, thank you for the video.
Disappointed to see MATLAB not on this list 😭
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pEfrdAtAmqk&amp;t=694">11:34</a> LOL 👏
I don&#39;t know where i am in the iceberg, i know c, c#, js, html, css, a bit of rust, python, lua and extremely basic java
nah man the first language I learned was theTransferOfEnergyScript
Where is rec room cv2
this video should have ended with the ultimate language which is the basis for quantum mechanics, the psyche, the soul, that language with which god created the universe, javascript. even for him it took 6 days to complete the project and he deleted most of the code and rewrote is several times.
I started to take C++ seriously in around 2018 or so. It took me 2 or so years to get decent at the language. But honestly, i don’t regret it at all. It’s by far the most powerful language. It might not be the most profitable one, but I’m too deep now to care about money lol
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pEfrdAtAmqk&amp;t=649">10:49</a> oh my god why. WHY. Imagine trying to maintain code like that. Holy shit
Le sabe al Shipost
This is just a programming roadmap.<br>Software development is SOOOO much more
The video took a dark turn man 😭🤣
So which is the hardest programming language in the world ??
islam answers all the questions like is there god control what you think and every thing and he is the only god in the world so you have why islam is correct
Scheme was mentioned 😎
Man that was amazing, great work! Would love to see more about lolcode and the emoji language
No Forth ? PL/1 ? MUMPS ? Modula ? Perl ? Pascal?
In highschool i learned C and then C++, assembly and logical circuits in uni just to do javascript for my job. AM I JOKE TO YOU?<br><br><br>--- I used phyton only as calculator in uni
I am so glad I waited til the ending. The ending was crazy good and funny! Never knew there was so much history to this and so many things I have never heard of
why is my life is Half-life?!?! (Lambdas)
I&#39;m missing &quot;language to write processors&quot;, like VHDL.
In 2 years, from 1986 to 1988, I reached the top and bottom of this video 😅: At the age of 12, I began programming in 1986 using BASIC on a French TO7/70. Two years later, I transitioned to writing 68000 assembly language on an Amiga 500
So well made video indeed. Especially now that I&#39;m reading some books from 80&#39;s and 90&#39;s, I get how those last levels are.
Great Road map
well... that kind of spiraled out of controll towards the end
What about Verilog , VHDL , SystemVerilog 😂.

once he said transistors i though &quot;where&#39;s verilog or vhdl?&quot;
bro i only asked you for a pencil
Ive searched for COW language with the Moo Moo syntax
Lil bro actually recommended PHP NAHHHH 💀💀💀💀
god:- he is too dangerous yk be left alive
Every self-respecting computer programmer should take at least one semester of C. Not to make a career on it no but to learn to how computer manages memory and why certain data structures are better for certain tasks. This helps a great deal in the future wherever you go in programming. I know C but I work in Python and if you say python is slow then screw you you just don&#39;t know how to use it. There is always NumPy, and if you really want to speed things up you can write a C  extension for that one particularly cpu-intensive task.
Holy moly, I felt dumb before this video. I feel even dumber now and even more in awe of programmers. Wow....
Rust is the only language
Start 😁, End 😳
That was entertaining 😂 especially the last part.
To get rich quich learn SAP ABAP or COBOL to work on ancient and/or hightly priced niche products. If you like to be universal useful and skilled, learn C , later C++.
Was that a THE CABLE GUY reference?
I might need a tutorial for the last one, like, do I just think of the code?
okey now I have to ask:where do you get all these memes dude?
I&#39;ve been wanting to learn programming for years but never thought it was for me, now I feel it is too late haha, I&#39;m just 20y old, maybe is not for me...
That was fun.
I skipped from web development ( HTML; CSS; JS) and python , c , batch, vbs, to x86 64bit linux assembly....

It&#39;s criminal to mention Scratch, which lacks variables and is not turing complete, without mentioning Snap!, Berkeley&#39;s fork of that turns it into a real language.
Missing is all the unique DSLs. Paradox Development Studio has their own scripting language with no documentation. Playing withe mesh renderer in Victoria 3 to spoof the number of buildings being built so it doesn&#39;t trigger a construction mesh to be triggered an ungodly amount of times every second, was fun. Also, another modder built an entire AI system to determine which building to build and where it would be most profitable. Thousands of lines of code in this simple script (dude has PTSD from some sections of that code and there&#39;s no documentation in sections of their mod because of it, I know this because I added my own economic system ontop of their&#39;s with awhole new ass game concept for it to consider. Dude, is a legend vanilla ai economies only reach about 700mil GDP. Dude got 4 of them to a billion and I got 6 of em there in AI only observed games)  just to get a 1/5 of what was historically accurate from the economies at the time.
I watched this three years ago was totally tripped out, now watching it again three years later i understand about 80% of these languages and am expired to learning how to use them. Who said NZT-48 is limited to a pill lol
this video got phylosophical really quick
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pEfrdAtAmqk&amp;t=738">12:18</a> i believe there’s a version of this where if you’re not polite enough it won’t run, and if you’re too polite it also won’t run 😅
My school made us learn C++ as an intro into coding 🥲
From <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pEfrdAtAmqk&amp;t=900">15:00</a> it&#39;s just an average Assembly programer&#39;s thoughts
The end escalated pretty quickly
I love Python:)
Okay but what do I do after all that?
I fell sleep at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pEfrdAtAmqk&amp;t=391">6:31</a> 🤣questioning my life&#39;s decisions
When I got to the end I was thinking to myself: what about programming using my mind?
Pointers &quot;point&quot; to a memory location. I wonder where that name came from? 🤡
&quot;Most production code out there is not functional&quot; too real
Does anyone ever learn or know all this languages? Is it even possible? <br>I think now a day for good carrier in programming, all you need is Python, JavaScript, Jave Ruby, C++
I asked chatgpt how I would write &quot;hello world&quot; in the Malbolge language. &quot;it is important to note that it is an extremely difficult and esoteric language that was specifically designed to be very challenging to use. It was created as a kind of parody of obfuscated programming languages, and is often considered one of the most difficult programming languages to learn.<br><br>That being said, if you are determined to print &quot;hello world&quot; in Malbolge, you can try the following code&quot;<br>Lol bot said that last sentence as if it was saying &quot;Hey if you wanna die here&#39;s how you do it&quot;<br><br>(for those curious this was the code: (=&lt;`#9]~6ZY32Vx/4Rs+0No-&amp;Jk)&quot;Fh}|Bcy?`=&lt;dL^$tu*8Y)\:1;[w]sU9{OM&lt;n%`Hf!$rCsu6&gt;7z5m)
Right so theoretically if I was a complete noob trying to choose between Lua, C++, and Nim it would probably be best to go with Lua? Checks out I guess.
Why do I even watch this I have no idea what he is even talking about, but I like it.
Good video but missed opportunity to make the punchline Matlab lol
Are there any ultrachads, who program on NASM?
This is dope!
Just discovered, such a gem of a channel. 💯
Not gonna lie, I lost it at C-- and holy C. Developers are nuts. lol
God tier programming? Terry Davis
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pEfrdAtAmqk&amp;t=278">4:38</a> i know i&#39;m kinda late, but Kotlin was created in Russia(named after island in St. Petersburg). Jetbrains have HQ is Prague but had huge offices in Russia before February 2022. Then Russia invaded Ukraine and they closed everything in Russia
There&#39;s VHDL / Verilog for CPLD&#39;s and FPGA&#39;s, to program the logic gates and build custom silicon, like bitcoin ASIC miners or other hardware accelerators.<br>FPGA&#39;s primarily used in modern network interfaces, like Mellanox (now Nvidia) and Broadcom, to churn through network traffic right when it comes as a light ray (process known as offloading). Processing data directly onto network interfaces with the help of FPGA&#39;s now known as DPU (data processing unit). For instance, you can host a minecraft server right on you 200Gbit/s Nvidia Bluefield Network Card, by programming an ARM cpu and installing a linux box there.
I missed PostScript and LaTeX.

In my master&#39;s we were taught how to use Csound. It was a fucking pain to learn coming from JS and Python, but it&#39;s so much better for the audio purposes we needed.
Came for the programming, stayed for the existential crisis. 10/10
Magnetic Core Memory: Hold my beer! Starts knitting 🧶🧵🪡
Loved the ShitCoin, would invest.
I was following until about 5 minutes in
When I started at University we learned Modula 2 and Bash in the first year, In the second year I learned C++,C, VHDL and Assembler. In the final year we were taught Ml and  Lisp and my final year project was in implemented C++.You said in your video that C was invented in 1969 and was used to write Windows and Linux? But in reality it was invented in 1972 to rewrite Unix from assembler in something higher.<br>Unix was invented in 1969!
This video really excited me and pointed me in the direction to do what I want and now I have to do better thank you for sharing this knowledge.
I&#39;m currently studying a degree on software dev and I&#39;m supposed to learn Assembly in just a couple months, it&#39;s so stressful.
ok i will never understand how computer works
as always, the deepest layer was my favourite hahaha, thanks again for reframing all of this in some cosmic conceptual thought-experiment fireship.
Bro the coding languages at the bottom are hella good
By the time I learn all these languages it will be worthless
Note: Kotlin is not just used for Android apps, it is generally used to replace Java on the JVM, and it can also do multiplatforming. APL is not just historically important, it is used in data manipulation applications.
Ok... So that was awesome.
you know what could be missing in the god tier roadmap? Physics. it&#39;s like the programming language of the universe itself.
It never ends in philosophy. I graduated my college with a philosophy degree, but I feel like a retard even after one year of coding self-study. The conformal cyclic cosmology applies to programming learning
There&#39;s just no way there are developers in this comment section with all the typos.
I&#39;m 40 years old and started learning C-Sharp but I&#39;m wondering if I can be a programmer after this age 😢
HTML is not a programming language
I use temple OS😊
where does the forth programming language fit in there?  It looks like a generalized assembler (not dependent on machine architecture).  I heard about it in the &#39;80s but never got to use it.
first bank I worked for blew my mind how much money COBOL programmers make, all while using a language older than my parents
I figured the deepest code on the iceberg would have been DNA programming, but eh okay
Alhumdulilah , I only know Assembly Language &amp; know how to write programs.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pEfrdAtAmqk&amp;t=18">0:18</a> - This image is more realistic than I expected...
I&#39;m a beginner and all I&#39;ve done is set up an ide and bought a book on learning c++ and now I&#39;m scared
I feel a bit called out by this. Heres a quick simplification of how my programming journey went<br><br><br>I started with html, css, and js<br>Went to python<br>Then c#<br>Dabbled in lolcode and brainf#!k and eventualy got decently good at whitespace lang, even making a small game<br>Then learned c, followed by trying c++ and not liking the slight changes, so istead went other dirrection with c89 and stuck with it instead<br>Attempted to learn haskell but it made brain hurt<br>So instrad i then turned to assembly, 8080 and 16bit x86 <br>And am currently on my venture of studying vacuum tube computers and hopefully designing a small scale one, transistors are too modern<br><br>This was all in the span of ruffly 3 years, currently my main language is C89, however i also use K&amp;R C for some systems if needed and 8080 ASM, both mainly CP/M machines. With that in mind, if i need something done quick and dirty ill use python. And im also highly fluent in batch scripts, dos and windows editions. But less so in bash, and have virtualy nothing in powershell. <br><br>Well thanks for reading i dont realy know why you did but hi anyways
Programming is a total shit❤❤❤❤
KTHXBYE
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pEfrdAtAmqk&amp;t=988">16:28</a> can we go back to SCRATCH please 😢
Followed up by C# is a bit disingenuous.  Microsoft took Java in the 90s and added a bunch of functionality that would only work in the Java VM they wrote, called Virtual J++. Sun (who owned Java at the time) took Microsoft to court and eventually won, requiring Microsoft not implement Java pretty much ever again. During the time this lawsuit was going on (late 90s to early 2000s), Microsoft took their J++ and created a new programming language called C#. So yes, C# is a &quot;follow up&quot; on Java, but it&#39;s a follow up because a court told them they couldn&#39;t use Java.
Forgot about that programming language called Chicken where all that you can write is the word chicken
This iceberg is really deep lol
Wow thanks!
Hey, I know I&#39;m late but &#39;Piet&#39; is not Pee-et but more like &#39;Pete&#39;. At least, that is how Piet Mondriaan pronounced it; no clue what the programmer did. The &#39;ie&#39; is a long &#39;i&#39;, so like &#39;ee&#39; (need) or &#39;y&#39; (baby) in English.
Good video, but was expecting some Perl love. That language was pretty significant during the dot boom. I know a lot of Amazon’s stack back in the day was heavily Perl.
OMG, it reminded me of my college days. Programming in Lisp, COBOL and Prolog. Once you survive Lisp, everything looks a piece of cake.
I actually learned Assembly in college, man you making me feel nostalgic
I was expecting you to mention ActionScript which, when Flash was still a thing, you could basically build anything you would find on a desktop app in the browser.
15 years ago I skipped the whole basic thing and jumped right into PHP. I still have flashbacks that send chills down my spine how ridiculously hard it was to pick up lol. Glad I did though, Haven&#39;t used it in the last 5 years but it will always be near and dear to my heart.
HTML is NOT a programming language!<br><br>It is a scripting language and has never met the criteria of a programming language. <br><br>LOL, I&#39;m currently learning a variation of Micro COBOL in order to keep supporting a legacy application for work.<br>I need to ask for a raise. It runs in a CPM based virtual machine!<br><br>PS. I also used to program in 8Bit assembly for the MB Vectrex Console for fun, untill my Vectrex broke a couple of years ago.
How could you skip ABAP⁉️
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pEfrdAtAmqk&amp;t=975">16:15</a> real
I remember saying that C++ should be called C-- because of how you need an external library for basically anything so I&#39;m surprised that it&#39;s an actual language lmao
What
I&#39;ve gone down the quantum mechanics rabbit-hole and I&#39;ve never been the same again
@<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pEfrdAtAmqk&amp;t=823">13:43</a> Wowww!
PL/1 and Expect.  All ya ever need.
No Verilog or VHDL, both lower than C but faster to write than Assembly.
Hell of an ending!
Java. Code once, DEBUG EVERYWHERE.<br><br>In the final stage you leave the computer and keyboard behind and start working with your mind.
The oasis of knowledge is a mirage in the desert of ignorance.
loved the end &lt;3 u sir are a brilliant mind
Quantum programming languages were not introduced. I had a course on quantum programming. It was more mindfuck than any of these languages
Hilarious tour of the nerd world! If it weren’t for the egos involved, we’d have had ChatGPT years ago. Now it’s here and will obsolesce the lion’s share of workflow bottlenecks which selfish programmers thrive on, because yes, there’s a God out there who wishes folks would just get along and not keep trying to prove they’re better than someone else.
I can&#39;t stop watching this vid despite wanting to close it, and zoned out after 2nd teir. mind blown
You forgot about Objective-C, used for Mac programming based on Apple re-incorporating NeXTSTEP into Mac OS X. Basically C with Smalltalk bolted on. And there was Modula-2 (as well as Modula, Modula-3, and Oberon), which was the step up from Pascal with a lot of C principles added in. I loved and still love both languages, and even do a bit of GNUStep programming with gnuC&#39;s Obj-C front-end compiler from time to time. And yea, I&#39;m learning COBOL for real now, the reason I found this vid!
&quot;Pointers&quot; are a reference to pointing at a memory location, NOT a gun.<br><br>Great video
I come from the bottom to go up
ASSEMBLY
As a man who often program in C, asm is the language i currently worship
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pEfrdAtAmqk&amp;t=164">2:44</a> - Did you include that sentence to provoke people like me to comment? HTML is obviously not a programming language.
I am unironically fluent in Assembly X86. School decided I should take 3 classes with it…
I could barely hear a child&#39;s voice.
Where is Delphi? 😢
idk either bro!
My main programming language is c++. But I usually programming brain f when I&#39;m bored
that JS push at the end, i laughed really hard :D
Can&#39;t say FUCK but you can talk about Terry Davis all day long. lol. lmao even
I&#39;ll test all of them with GPT4 ! Thanks !
ME 🤔 wondering why no Visual Basic mention after I built 10000 line highly functional app for our business
I feel kinda proud just having started my apprenticeship as a IT systems engineer and already programming some small things in cobol
First dabbled in APL at a Coding Camp at the UNSW. Then onto Uni in Brisbane (Qld, Australia) learning Pascal, to train our minds to be logical &amp; organised. Then coding in COBOL on datasheets which were sent to a typing pool, to produce punch cards which we fed into the mainframe. We could then access the programme on a green-screen monitor (usually at 2am, due to the ratio of students to access ports)... etc, etc, etc (in Yul Brenner&#39;s voice)
almost 17 minutes and you blew my mind. omg too much info
I used to call SQL &quot;squirrel&quot;
soy based languages
imagine meeting the psycho that programs using f!&amp;king machine code<br><br>theyre out there
Correct HTML and CSS is not programming languages, but page renders, similar to postscript or even RTF. <br>Despite it can do a few calculations, you can not generate a real standalone app..
Pascal is still being taught in Uruguay&#39;s public university and it&#39;s required to pass Programming 1. To quote some friends that are studying there, &quot;It&#39;s like they force you to use an old rusty blender that no one has even touched in 50 years, and after you´ve learned all it&#39;s quirks and problems you are given a completely new and functional blender and they tell you that you are never gonna use or se that old one ever again&quot;.
Java : write once, debug everywhere. Got  me 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
I remember taking an assembly course for the X86 architecture. To this day I still don&#39;t know why I did it. Once he talked about logic gates, I went into the fetal position remembering those horrible days learning about discrete structure 😫
Me, who decided learn Python thinking that it is a good idea.
I am currently learning assembly after having learned the basics of C, C++, R and Python in just the first year of software engineering, I wasn&#39;t expectating to be so low in the iceberg that fast.
Bro I just did it backwards
Stuck on tier 3 and dabbled in tier 6. Fight me.
After decades of professional programming my advice is:<br><br>Phase 1 (&quot;How software and computers work&quot;): Learn and use C for some practical projects until your mindset adapts to control yourself your resources, like memory, pointers, handles and all that. Most people think this is something useless nowadays, but I strongly disagree. I did it for years in commercial videogames and prepared me with a really solid base for being more organized with data structures, efficient algorithms, memory optimization and code performance. In this phase you will break A LOT of things, and debug a lot of code, and that&#39;s exactly the point.<br><br>Phase 2 (&quot;How software is made nowadays&quot;): Learn basic OOP, but don&#39;t go too far into its more obscure features. The language in this step is not that important, OOP is mostly the same everywhere. This will give you a new layer of skills for code organization, modularility and reusability. Using a strongly-typed language at this point can be a bonus to better learn about code organization and reusability.<br><br>Phase 3 (&quot;I already know what I&#39;m doing&quot;): Once you know how to organize your data and your code, and OOP is mostly natural for you when you design the structure of your projects, you are in the perfect moment to jump to a loosely-typed OOP language like Python 3 (or Php 8 if web is your thing) and don&#39;t look back. At this point you know what your code does and how your data is structured, so you won&#39;t need a paranoid-narcissistic language (like Java) taking you by the hand reminding you all the time what you can do and what you can&#39;t. At this phase the main point must be &quot;what you want to do&quot;, not &quot;what the stupid compiler wants you to do&quot;, because you are the programmer and YOU are in charge, not the language ;)<br><br>BONUS TRACK: When you will learn the most your trade is by finishing projects, and I mean it. Starting projects is easy, exciting and fun, but finishing a polished project requires a huge amount of effort and patience (and pain and suffering too). Every FINISHED project will level up your knowledge by a lot.
thank for your informative video but your facts have some holes in them now a days its hard to classify a language as (functional or imparatives) java since 6 years suuport functional lambda notation so as c# and javascripts. and how the language support fully or partialy the functional paradigm vs the turing imparatives way. i gotta say your video will not age well later on but anyway thanks again for the video keep it up
&quot;You can do things the hard way or the harder way if your smart you can do it the hard way but 99% of people succeed with the harder way&quot;
finally i have a glimpse an understanding of how this thing works. I never understood how the first code was written so people could code on some coded code and you rubbed my face into the egoic illusional existence so it didnt matter, but it felt good for a second.
So what if I start from the bottom of the iceberg?
That ending was fire 🔥🔥😂
Where is Kali at?
Welp, that took a hard left at the end
Some PLC’s out there use assembler. Which can be fun…….<br>Error coding for Profibus often uses hexadecimal. <br>Industrial programming can be fun.
You are fun.
&quot;Piyat&quot; hahahha
oh wow i really did reach end of iceberg, whats deeper than yourself
I could only endure until <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pEfrdAtAmqk&amp;t=380">6:20</a>. Thank you for making me feel even dumber than before.
So I live in romania, and our school system thinks that in 9th grade you should start learning C++, without any prior knowledge about anything programming related. During the first Informatics class of the year, we started off with LEARNING HOW TO MAKE AN F-ING FOLDER IN FILE MANAGER(which mostly all of us knew already how to do), and two weeks after that, started in C++.
I started with Assembler, I found a world where I could manipulate pulses around circuits and microprocessors DIRECTLY.
lul lul lul
You missed Karl ++
I was a little bit sorry to see you passed on a perfect opportunity to talk about FPGA design languages like Verilog after mentioning transistors and gates, but your digression into epistemology was surely more entertaining!
the end was very inspiring!
Genius. Thanks for making this glorious video.  Epic ending BTW
I know COBOL well, having written entire systems with it a long time ago. I am now a janitor. I am happy.
The 3 idiots hospital picture, I see you.
Time to dive deeper into the matrix it would appear.
I started with assembly when I was 14. And 20 years later I&#39;ve started using it professionally.
You missed Register Transaction Languages such as Verilog and VHDL, they belong somewhere between assembly and transistors, since they are used to arrange gates and flip flops in an integrated circuit.
Me in college learning Visual Basic. Oh no
You just gave me existential crisis at the final part
No VHDL or Verilog - well, the most important ones to design computer hardware
This video exactly reflects how my brain works

By level 3, I literally tuned out and started scrolling like someone blacking out as a defense mechanism when experiencing extreme trauma. <br>Hopefully I don&#39;t start sperging out PTSD style when trying to learn soy based react lol. <br>I&#39;m already a stereotype before I get started, Fk it I&#39;m gonna create my own language called Chad -.
I love your humour. Praise be to our lord and savior T.Davis
i didnt even started learning a<br>ny programming language but im already quitting
Another historically important language was IBM’s PL/I (for “Programming Language One”), a mashup of FORTRAN, COBOL, and ALGOL, which was actually quite good in the mainframe environment, except for slow compiling due to its extensive optimization (on by default but could be turned off).<br><br>PL/I spawned a few descendants, such as PL/S (S for “Systems”), developed by IBM for coding internal operating systems modules (much like C) and  Sabretalk, a stripped down version of PL/I to replace S/360 Assembler for applications to run in an airline reservation system, developed by American Airlines for its SABRE system, later becoming an industry standard for other airlines (but all the program and system building was done on IBM S/360 using DOS/360 and later using OS/360).  The stripped down OS was called ACP, or Airline Control Program, but proved useful for other high performance real-time systems such as financial companies, and was later sold by IBM as TCP, or “Transaction Control Program.”  The TCP (ACP) operating system, that is, which I suppose must have included the Sabretalk language and compiler.<br><br>Writing control card statements to run multi-step (or even single-step) batch jobs was complex enough for OS/360 (all the way from OS/PCP to MVT), and to a lesser extent for DOS/360, to be considered a language in itself: Job Control Language, or JCL.
When i said this i got the same hate 🌚🌝👾
I tried solving a java question with js knowledge. I answered but not replied
The brainf**k bit had me laughing 🤣🤣🤣
I couldn&#39;t believe we were still using Pascal until 2022. What a waste of life.
How could you not even mention perl??? Larry is deeply offended and so am I! :-P
Brainfuck
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pEfrdAtAmqk&amp;t=899">14:59</a> background noise lol
Semua bahasa pemrograman mengklaim dirinya yang paling mudah, ujung ujungnya balik ke c++.
Man they don&#39;t add cheat engine asm
opinion: as a developer with good education you will automatically go through each layer of this ice berg. but understanding and using those languages makes you just a good programmer. <br><br>so for all viewers that got intimidated by this iceberg: there is more ...<br><br>to be a good developer you need also abilities in software architecture, software design, process abstraction, documentation, quality assurance,  anti-patterns, ... and many more.<br><br>professional developing is a universe in its own and anything else but easy money. <br><br>and when you look at the AI evolution nowadays (e.g. copilot), the programming itself might step back in future and the skills around programming could become more important.
This video was shit ngl, it listened what makes the programs different but it dosent explain what the terms mean. Like low lv high lv object orientated doing this doing that like bro  Google can tell me  this
I didn&#39;t understand half of the words in the video 👍
Videos that give you a quick roadmap with a hint of nihilism are not helpful. I grew up with computers, I learned how to program when I was 14 because my schools had classes that taught JS HTML CSS and other languages. I did go straight into computer science. I am now a full stack web developer and computer scientist. Seeing this video before my program and after is hilarious because the missing ingredient is time and effort. You can code if you want to you leave your friends behind, and if they don&#39;t code they aren&#39;t any friends of mine. I was early to the party and early to leave and it took me a while to get back to the party and now I&#39;m straying for the afterparty.
I just wanted to know how to make a roblox game what the fuck im seeing
I&#39;m glad I started with C and C++. Moving to other languages from them was so simple.
bro ............. i started learning with c++ lmao and then going back to python and java script n stuff
I started my programming journey but never started from scratch😂😂😂😂
I absolutely love how I happen to have at least written a classic &quot;hello world&quot; programme (or its equivalent, as you don&#39;t exactly do that in sql) in at least one language in almost every tier of this iceberg, and done so in a completely chaotic order.<br><br>I mean it. The chronological order of my learning goes: python, binary, scratch, html, css, Brainf*ck, c++, c#, sql, pascal.<br><br><br><br>So I had lots of fun watching this video - it&#39;s completely accurate xD
After i watched this Video, i learned Cobolt and got rich
what has Jesus done to you? it&#39;s not nice to mock him like that in the thumbnail. But the video is cool.
How amazing how your portrayed physics as a programming language of the electric particles, which it is
What an amazing sense of humor for creating a whole programming languages for a parody, soo goood
top tier
Need to discuss requirements. The programming you learn should be driven by what you are trying to make
Babbage &gt; Lovelace
No mention of Hoon??
Absolutely loved the last 30 seconds of this video
Where’s temple OS 😅
Jobs be like: have all this, 5 years, and maybe you get 6 month intern.
and where 1s programming ? )))
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pEfrdAtAmqk&amp;t=416">6:56</a> if you listen closely you can hear a kid in the background.
thank you I quite my job and now I am homeless🚫🏠😔
You forgot DNA.
I like how in one moment we go from actual programming languages to straight up philosophy
you are a god
That. . .really took a turn there near the end. . .
Me at the first few minutes: yes<br><br>Me at the very end of the vid: what the f#@k is this shit
Brilliant video. Technically great, but the idea of going from higher up to all the way down to bytecode is brilliant. Kind of like that famous space video where the zoomin to you sitting in a park, from way up from another galaxy.
Is it a bad thing that I didnt understand fucking anything he was saying until he got down to the bottom of the iceberg?
I started a course of game developer 1 week ago, but in Java, now I know why is it so hard 💀
I love how Asmongold is on this thumbnail
great video, you forgot the best programming language... WARIOWARE DIY FOR THE NINTENDO DS
Does anyone actually know all these intricately? Or just superficially? Quality is better than quantity imo.
In college we do this bottom to top
i was crying at chef. oh god that is just the best.
Dr. Racket is the first programming language I learn in uni (hate it)
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pEfrdAtAmqk&amp;t=697">11:37</a> hahahaha
Bruhhhhh\
You had me at Goonies ♥
I expected to see Matlab at the very bottom :(
What? No ladder logic?
I’ve twice tried to learn Java but it’s so complicated. I also spent about 6 months learning HTML and CSS, which was just at the right difficulty to be challenging and enjoyable. Then when I went to college the teacher said “You’ll be learning HTML as well. It’s so easy, you’ll learn it in a couple weeks”, which just made me feel really stupid and like I’d never learn programming, but that was total bullshit anyway.
The programming language is the least important thing to learn in programming.<br>This is what you learn from learning a lot of different programming languages.

so basically if you go below sea level, if you don&#39;t drown first you freeze to death.
I will learn holy c, it seems interesting.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pEfrdAtAmqk&amp;t=630">10:30</a> My father lost his job because of Covid. So he, being born in the mid 60&#39;s, decided to become a contractor. He now makes 10k more what he used to by converting code from Cobol to whatever the hell they&#39;re switching to. Thanks, Cobol!
Its tiime to go backk to farming..
I&#39;m going to create an open world videogame using &quot;epistomology&quot;, wish me good luck.
I had 6 months of assembly classes at my college, not fun to learn
You hit the bottom of the iceberg, and just kept going. Love it.
Its not really about which languages, but about the process.
Where is python in the theme
Racket? Nah, that’s Pepsi
Maybe I missed it, but where is LISP?
Absolute banger vid, provides us with ton of knowledge and then even make me laugh :D
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pEfrdAtAmqk&amp;t=167">2:47</a> how is HTML a programming language?
I know how to program in far too many of these languages.
Nice to know that the language I&#39;m most familiar with (C++) is one of the three Chads!
Hey you didn&#39;t talk about Rust.....
In college we had to take an IBM mainframe assembly course and we were tested on reading the machine code. Good times.
Solidity is trash. It should go to the garbage pile of history with the ethereum shitchain.
Visual Basic never gets any love.
Wasn&#39;t php invented by a danish guy?
For transistor programming, you an go full Chad and learn FGPA (Field Programmable Gate Arrays) Tech like Xilinx. Saves the trouble of soldering and you can configure hundreds of thousands of logic gates on a single chip. Makes every function execute in one clock cycle. Or for the brave you can run them asynchrously, in which the speed of electricity becomes your fundamental constraint.
God-tier developer roadmap: Rust all the way
I remember in highschool &#39;95 we were using turbo Pascal. It was interesting I just don&#39;t think our teacher understood beyond the very basics and only taught it to a certain point. I wish I toughed it out though.
Don&#39;t know why, but my first language was C++, i love it
What I find almost terrifying is how old some of these household names in programming languages are. That means we&#39;re just a bunch of potatoes. The real geniuses came in the 50s-70s. We&#39;re just breathing their rear ends.
I did my FYP in solidity. <br>Creating a functional payable function was hardest part for me.<br>Then a person on ethereum StackExchange helped me out understanding that how it works.
Awesome!  But I missed D and  Rockstar :(
language is nothing outside the usage context
I thought you would have mentioned  VHDL And Verilog the languages used to design semiconductors at the lowest level.
As a PhD student in philosophy dealing mainly with epistemology and metaphysics I found that starting at the bottom does NOT make it easier.
i started on scratch a bit, quit for a year and then went to batch files where i am lol
Just wrote my first line of code in python(print(&quot;hello world&quot;). Can&#39;t wait to master INTERCAL and make billions!
Lol. I watched the whole thing despite being lost after HTML.
at the end you&#39;re just playing with the language
Piet is actually pronounced like &quot;Pete&quot;.
Just realised that I am surviving on the tip of the tip
Welp guess im just skipping to the end of this in my digital circuits class xD
The adeptus mechanicus wish to know your location
Me who start with Java
I&#39;m in my C# Class doing ATM Simulator and Windows Forms, which I find very complicated as I have zero coding experience. Giving me a little bit of headache now and a little challenging as I also work full time job as tech support, any tips? I&#39;ve been constantly watching youtube videos, ask questions to ChatGPT and Google, I really feel the learning curve, aghh :D
didnt the guy who made rollercoaster tycoon use assembly?
some youtubers know all these languages :(-
You forgot <b>batch language.</b>
Programming languages are like Kung Fu style.. they may all look different and are called with different name.. but the basic of Kung Fu is punching and kicking lol!!!
i took computer science in 2008 and learned C and C++. Eventually, got a job in developing apps. the pay was peanut so i decided to jump to a company that design a web. had to learn js and html. it was fun. then the guy that design the ui/ux quit. I had to learn how to website ui/ux design. The company sent me to adobe photoshop, illustrator and ui/ux class. From then my journey as a graphic designer started. Felt in love with it. Quit the website design job and went full freelance doing graphic designs. Last year, suddenly i missed doing programming. since im into Apple Ecosystem, i went for Swift. Love it so much.
I did programming but the pay was shit. I became a doctor, much better chicks and less neckbeardism
In the end ... I rely do not know what to say ... i do not have word man...
I think you forgot WebAssembly.
I will stay with my very basic coding skills and the ability to write hardly anything in kotlin and call it good.
the ayahuasca trip lmao, thatś me
Looooooooooooooooooooooooooonngggeeeessstttttt.... 16 minute of my life
Loved the last level... A but of philosophy always makes my day 👌🏻<br><br>But on the few last levels you forgot Hardware Description Languages like VHDL and Verilog so you can literally implement behaviour at a hardware level on FPGAs and feel like a wizard doing black magic 😂😂
All coding is the same the more you do it the more you realize
Just because you can write it efficiently in something else doesn&#39;t mean doing it in python isn&#39;t going to he easy.
Good hahah
Of course much could be said about any of these and you can&#39;t cover everything, but Golang allows you to do memory management using the &quot;Unsafe&quot; package, including pointer arithmetic. But there&#39;s  reason for it to be called unsafe

i dont know a thing about software dev but that sure was a lot of words you said
I started with HTML and CSS, then moved into python, then to Java, then Bash, C and NASM assembly LOL. Then I moved to C++ and am slowly learning it.
Why is AiAhH00ASCA not a language
I learned many years ago with a language called “just basic.” It was next level awful because it would sometimes straight up ignore statements (at least in the free version). I worked around it by copy and pasting important statements 10 times or so. Sometimes that wouldn’t even work. But it was good enough for me to learn
Me a haskell programmer.... <b>eject myself</b>
oh man my computer architecture professor made us all learn assembly programming and the final exam had us HAND WRITE assembly code. On a paper sheet. Then he&#39;d run it in his computer.<br>I got a good grade surprisingly. It was very much worth learning it.
i studied c++ for a bit but ive forgotten it all. darn it
No &quot;Folders&quot;?
this is a good history class on Programming languages.
... thanks for the video...<br>I shouldn&#39;t have watched this right before I go to bed.
While this was somewhat interesting, I kinda don&#39;t get it. I never had a class in programming. I have been a professional programmer for about 30 years. I don&#39;t know any language well. However, I have used as many as 30 or more in my career. Apps include pacemakers, library search engines, accounting, HVAC, injection molding, aeronautical, machine control, and things I can&#39;t remember. The languages included RPG and PLM that didn&#39;t make your list. Why should I care about the language. I write solutions, NOT CODE. The secret to programming is the ability to understand the customer&#39;s need (better than the customer). And the ability to work against incredible odds.

I learned binary, how to read and count in binary, along with organize in binary and how to make the first blocks. Now I&#39;m studying the hardware so I can start making those blocks and work my way up the chain and take apart coding languages like C and understand how they work on the base level. Along with where print function derives from since that will be the most important function I can ever imagine for making a working text base, without accidentally combining objects using a baseline operating system. when I start doing the higher languages of coding, I rather make the code the tool and not be the tool myself, for not understanding the flags that executes the things that make coding so easy today. that and I wanna know it all like the back of my hand so when I get a career I can pretty much pick up anything or do anything with relative ease from a base machine object coding understanding. even make my own operating systems &amp; languages, which I&#39;m glad I didn&#39;t learn high level coding yet, because I&#39;m understanding the building blocks of those languages, and working on my organization, planning and execution &amp; overall understanding of the system and various parts of the system before I go into assembly so I have a easier time putting all that stuff together from understanding why it works. So, the skills of organizing binary and understanding assembly translates over to planning projects on higher level languages. it&#39;s really fun and challenging, like putting the pieces together and discovering exactly how the puzzle goes together without being told it just works. it&#39;s actually being able to say 2 volts is on, and 4 volts is off.
this video&#39;s ending... is such a mood. lmfao
FC me......This is Too much......<br><br><br><br>But I Like It
🙆🏽‍♂️
Yes.  I was programming my TI99/4a in TIBasic when the Goonies were all the rage.  Now I&#39;m all weepy and nostalgic.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pEfrdAtAmqk&amp;t=30">0:30</a> <br>Ahh yes, the Mandleberg.
So glad I began coding with HTML/CSS/JavaScript at twelve. Now I have the mental ability and fortitude to learn Chef, which has always been my ultimate goal.<br><br>Thank you for enlightening me to the paths of the esoteric revolution.
I dunno man things exist or they don&#39;t  either way you&#39;re there. Also great video.
Wish I had this video before I wasted my GI Bill at ITT Tech yo learn &quot;programming &quot;. I was so dumb.
At the bottom of the iceberg is basicly just pain.
Stack-based languages omitted, how rude (Forth asnd Factor).
The most hardcore programming language is cartesian philosophy.
i&#39;m new to programming and started with counting binary codes! wish me luck guys
ok so my XP, gate logic &gt; 101010101010 &gt; ASM &gt; Fortran &gt; pascal &gt; C/C++ &gt; javascript also ladder diagrams oh and scratch.
I&#39;m a cobol programmer. It&#39;s big money but not as fun as modern languages.

&quot;Pointers got that name because it&#39;s like pointing a gun at someone&quot;<br>Was that programming humor?
Modula 2
He forgot the most important language of all: Vala
In esoterica, you missed the language Rock Star.
so the only programming language i know is the at the fourth level, nice.<br>I guess my high school teacher was a chad
very cool the ending bringing a philosophical reflection, which is actually true, everything ends in philosophy
It got really terrifying and messy that I couldn&#39;t tell the point where he ended his main video idea and proceeded with philosophy
I find it amusing that you mention R is for people who work in data science, yet my data science module on my physics degree is taught in python and the data science PhD im interested in is centred around python. PYTHON &gt;&gt;&gt;
wow as a brazilian I&#39;m glad you mentioned Lua <br>chat GPT doesn&#39;t even know Lua
I think, therefore I am
I hate that you never discovered R
I KNEWW I HAD SEEN THAT MEME OF MOSS SOMEHWRE BEFORE!<br><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pEfrdAtAmqk&amp;t=221">3:41</a><br>I just started watching the IT crowd and when it was the fire scene I was like &quot;I&#39;ve seen a gif of that somewhere&quot; and I knew it was either a fireship or Ben Shapiro video lol. Here it is. :D
Great video!  Guess I&#39;ll go kill myself now...
this escalated quickly
I did &quot;hello world&quot; the other day. This shit is easy
Piet is pronounced like Pete
Guys first year in Informatics sciences, we have assembly course...<br>Noice
R.I.P. Terry
ending hits hard
i couldnt understand a thing after python
C its just C
The first language I was taught was C in university. Memory management was the worst thing to even experience, then we went to Java the next semester.....
I started with assembly and moved to C what am I?
1 minute into the video, and I&#39;m terrified on how you say &quot;this iceberg is just the tip of the iceberg&quot;.<br>And 3 minutes in, I&#39;m absolutely horrified on how many of programming software exist... What&#39;s In my mind is &quot;am I in the right major...?&quot;
F**k life. I had to start with Java.<br>It is compulsory for 10th grade icse students.
Wait a minute, where’s ACOS?
You missed out microcode which can change the machine code a CPU runs.
Great video 👍
Emojicode sounds like Gen Z programming
Trying to keep up with the latest flavor of the month framework or coding language is like swimming upstream... by the time you get proficient its already outdated. Many corporate IT shops chase after these frameworks only to abandon them after two years for the next new shiny object.
I&#39;m not even a programmer but this was entertaining enough to watch until the end. Also, did I detect a Cable Guy reference at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pEfrdAtAmqk&amp;t=946">15:46</a>?
Man, the goal of my internship during my bachelor was to calibrate sensors with a traction bench<br>I had to use the Labview language....I&#39;ve never seen such a mess since then
so your telling me, I stuided and still  learning Java and C++ just for nothing .-.
Well, time to start learning Malbolge.....why do I love misery?
What&#39;s up with the suspiciously po*n sounding things in the background? :D (Eg. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pEfrdAtAmqk&amp;t=939">15:39</a> )
At your lowest or deepest level you forgot HDL languages like VHDL and Verilog.
So where do app specific programming languages fit in in the iceberg? Like Flash&#39;s Actionscript or BYOND&#39;s DM?
How come objective c was never mentioned😮
Where is rexx and where is tcl/tk ?
Ah yes, I never failed to compile html and css in first time
Your video took a drastic turn at the end, but I appreciate the information and your knowledge.
HTML is NOT A PROGRAMMING LANGUAGE. It&#39;s a documentation standard, just like PCL is for printers, only HTML is for browsers. HTML, CSS, Java are all document manipulators not real programming languages at all and not of them are compiled for distribution they all need to be interpreted, so again not real languages at all. They were created to support the desktop publishing from the deficient apple user community.
Damn, maybe Ted Kaczynski was right.
The first 2 rules about garbage collectors are:<br>1) Don&#39;t rely on them to &quot;just work&quot;.<br>2) Don&#39;t trust them.<br>That&#39;s just generally true. See the blow your leg off quote. Just that in this case: That blown off leg might wander off. Raise an undead army, arm it using your credit card and commit unspeakable things in your name. And you first hear about it when you are kidnapped by an opposing faction.<br><br>Which is probably the reason so many don&#39;t even claim to have garbage collection.
i do perl every day at work and i want to migrate to python so bad but we have so much legacy perl code that we still stick to perl.... i hate perl...
Assembler is way too romanticized by the Dunning-Kruger effect.<br>People who actually work with it curse about it jut as much as every other language. Especially the romanticized parts. They might cause flashbacks.<br>Seriously, present self modifying code with a smug face to someone who had to stay sober on new year 2k and they might drown you in your Starbucks coffee.<br>You see, its less about the amount of liquid and more where it goes.<br><br>Also machine code is just less convenient. It&#39;s already just 1:1 translated Assembler so not meaningfully different. Meaning there is usually no reason to write in machine code. The only difference is an even worse lack of readability then assembly. It&#39;s exactly one step worse then removing all white spaces from C code and fulfills the same purpose. Accelerating parsing by a completely insignificant amount of time by decreasing file size. It&#39;s worse because you removed documentation of what is supposed to be executed and what isn&#39;t.
I just came to tell you guys how effective that meme in the left corner was with getting me in here!
&quot;JavaScript was too easy so I mastered my body and mind, reached enlightenment, died for your sins and conquered the world&quot;
Great video! I love my trip on my self-taught, hobbyist programmer journey in comparison to your iceberg: C; C++; x86 assembly; HTML / CSS / Javascript / PHP / MySQL; erlang; Solidity.
Pascal is the lowest one I&#39;ve heard of on this list
Should have included HDLs like Verilog and VHDL.
You&#39;ve inspired me to wipe the drool from my chin and go to another video.
&quot;Another well-loved tool from Microsoft is...&quot;, as Gates is being shown on the screen. Hahaha
Okay but why did my old employer suggest learning abel
You forgot a whole level of languages which include SCL, LADDER, GRAFCET, FBD, IL and more
It&#39;s all true
<b>last programming language</b> <br><br>Wait wot ?
How is pascal harder than C++?
Type-safety is overrated
I am 17 and i want to make a carrer in programming what should i do ??? Pls anyone (who is not a child giving free knowledge)who has some experience in this field tell me <br>Thank u
Then there comes a milleanial influencer saying all of this is super weird and all you need to know is learn how to correctly ask ZackCBD..<br><br>(this is fantastic btw).
Assembler was fun in the DOS days, before writing an application with it just became a long series of DLL calls (to code that was probably written in C or  C++ anyway).
Bruh i thought u needed to know HTML and CSS to even begin to understand Java.. im switching majors
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pEfrdAtAmqk&amp;t=431">7:11</a>
all i learned is the bottom of the software engineering iceberg is just the beginning of the computer engineering iceberg
Back when I started studying Comp Sci at the university, the first programming course was in Scheme. They didn&#39;t have C in the curriculum, instead, if you wanted to read a C course you had to take the Automation &amp; Systems line course. They HAD a course in assembler.<br><br>The key idea they wanted to drive in, and hard, was that programming is easy, design and e.g. choosing the algorithms is the hard part. It still holds.<br><br>edit: Since I&#39;ve changed fields and do most of the stuff in Python. If speed is a requirement, out come Fortran &amp; C (it most often isn&#39;t, because a good algorithm beats a fast programming language)
What I learned: <br>First-tier: basics<br>Second-tier: crap<br>Third-tier: basics
And also, Kotlin is awesome 😄 really nice in structure
All tho, HTML is a markup language, CSS is a sheet of instructions for the DOM.
Where is VBS.
Nobody gonna mention the sounds in the background in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pEfrdAtAmqk&amp;t=896">14:56</a> ??
I did Business/CIS and Philosophy w/ Ethics and Public Policy as my dual major at Uni... I feel like this video would more easily explained how the inside of my head works than I care to admit. Epistemology is part of the reason I can&#39;t do hard drugs.
This is why I&#39;m glad I stopped at machine code. Assembly was OK, but the rest just got messy.
Nice job.<br><br>Js does everything
The further into the video I got, the more interesting it got. Then I got to the end of the video and felt like I just finished Neon Genesis Evangelion. <br><br>If you made it to the end of the video... Congratulations.
Then you have dependently typed programming languages, which also work as proof systems, where, rather than fighting the compiler to never give you undefined behaviour when you don&#39;t want it, you work with it and determine where undefined behaviour can happen yourself, at the cost of spending an order of magnitude more time writing proofs than programs.
Piet is pronounced as Pete with a short sounding &#39;e&#39;, not Pe-yet.

They&#39;re gonna run out of letters to name their programming languages after soon if they keep going at this rate and I don&#39;t particularly feel like learning kanji just to pronounce a programming language
You didn&#39;t mention Verilog/VHDL !  Ability to write code at the logic-gate level, to be loaded onto an FPGA typically.
Piet is pronounced as Peet
yeah this is brainfuck! ngl it was a good video. but...the end justified some other means

I found it hilarious how high level computational concepts drove you into an existential crisis contemplating the epistemological validity of your existence and perceptions.

Where is Kotlin?
Anything which cannot be written in javascript, can be written with node.js!
Fortran is still widely used in astrophysics lol
my mafia boss matlab is going to spank me for not making this list, thanks
My journey: Sinclair Basic -&gt; CBM-BASIC -&gt; Pascal -&gt; Java + SQL + Javascript + HTML -&gt; C++ &gt; C -&gt; Assembler - &gt; VB -&gt; C# -&gt; Bash. Still  know nothing...
HTML is not a programming language. It is a markup language. It&#39;s in the name... HyperText Markup Language.
God I can’t wait to become a welder 👨‍🏭
Great video besides the BS at the end about reality
Did he miss MATLAB?
The first programming language I learned was c++
I used to code ST megademos using ASM - the experience makes coding games in C++ feel more like Scratch..! 😂You forgot C#!
I hate my CS days, now I want back -_-<br>reverse psychology
i love approach that blueprints in unreal have - is there something like that for normal programing language? i find typing obsolete 😀
lol Squeel
Pascal was known to be good beginer language and was teached in school very often atleast here in poland, so i guesd it got replaced by Python
Really glad you mention LISP My favorite by far.
Real chads use a small magnet to manipulate ones and zeros on the processor
Love the pubg reference with the Kar98. Beautiful
LMAO what a great video!
hmm.. perl/raku is missing??
i aint learnin allat or...
In high school, I learned Java and taught myself html, css, js. In college, as a computer science major, I relearned Java, C/C++, Assembly (Arm/x86), Powershell, and Python.
Today I learned: Low-level compilers make soy-based languages possible.
i hate coding, unlucky i chose it as my path
time to drop out from Computer Science and transfer to Theology degree
Meanwhile the programming language I use daily for my job didn&#39;t even manage to get on this list.
miss opportunity to transition to a computer hardware video since its basically the other side lol
You forgot to say that the popular game Terraria was made in lua
C++ is actually above the C-level - you made a mistake in the thumbnail.
I&#39;m gonna start pronouncing SQL as Squeal from this day forward
You shouldn&#39;t learn languages, you should paradigms. Each paradigm is able to target on problem with a unique approach, sometimes there are multi paradigms languages like Mozart Oz. The clue here is about computer sciences core knowledge, that is the diferent between in the end.
How is the thumbnail Jesus + Matthew McConaughey + Asmongold 😂
You are just a simulation in my mind that thinks that is a simulation. Or you are reading a person&#39;s message right now of a person thinking that a guy doing programming language  YouTube videos  thinking that he lives in a simulation lives in his mind simulation.<br>Funny, isn&#39;t it ? x)
Kotlin programming language is missing
Trying to write the OOP C++ on  an empty sheet of paper while you are the debuger? yeah, 2016 had pcs but the prof. wanned to be slick. Welcome to highschool&#39;s real OG&#39;s class.
great!
Moral of this story? Ayahuasca is some serious s#&amp;% and HTML is a real programming language, or else Bulletin Board Systems would still be widespread.
I&#39;ve been working in my first developer position for about a year now, my job is to convert cobol code into bash script and yeah there is still a lot of money to be made in cobol!
As an electrical eng major, I feel targeted by this video. I only learned C, ASM, Matlab, and transistors, nothing else. When my everyday programming is just a tier away from fondamental philosophical existential crisis, I feel bad for myself.
&quot;soy-based languages&quot;<br><br>so are they soy or are they based? 🤔
and here I thought the last one was going to be DNA
Please remove the drawing of Jesus from the thumbnail. It is terribly offensive to Muslims
This thumbnail is on crack
Glaringly, you&#39;ve ignored Hardware Description Languages like Verilog or VHDL which is what digital designers use to design the blocks of logic you talked about to create the fundamental parts of a computer, like a multiplier or adder or memory.
I was taught Assembly at my university. It was such a pain that it was laughable, I couldn&#39;t even hate it. Hundreds of lines of code to make a few led lights in a board blink.
What about Forth? And D, Mi!!fork and Euphoria?
Im already at the base of the ice berg. You know you’ve gone beyond when “oral tradition “ and superstition effect your development. Typically youll have some shaman like figure to read the bones if your project and a soothsayer to decry the intricacies of the OS on your project. This isnt a joke/exaggeration.😂🎉

The first few minutes I thought: Great, i&#39;m well equipped for programming!<br><br>Shortly after, I thought: Fuck, what am i doing with my life?
i never though that learning from scratch means from actual &quot;scratch
Huh? HTLM is not a programming language, just like xml, json, markdown or yaml aren&#39;t either.<br>It&#39;s a markup language (it&#39;s literally in the name).<br><br>Technically it gained some scripting capabilities, but it&#39;s best to keep calling a horse a horse.
Zig is not to be confused by Nim lmao
So philosophy is the lowest level programming language 😂 /s

Yeah i hate JavaScript, sadly it&#39;s pretty much needed.
Ada 95 let’s gooo 😅❤
What kind of bullshit is this
I should check out APL, I really like how you can sometimes simply write mathematical expressions in python and julia.
I think... uhh, yeah.. time to consider another career.
In my opinion JavaScript isn&#39;t ugly at all. In fact it has the most elegant syntax
C#
Holy C yes!!
Just learn JavaScript and understand that this is a comedy video :)
This is not God-Tier Developer Roadmap. It&#39;s just my &quot;Introduction to Programming Languages&quot; class I take a year ago.

I liked that video!!
Did I just see a 3 idiots reference in This videos. This guys is legit
it is god tier for sure when it comes at the end
I worked at the baker berry library (the picture shown when dartmouth is mentioned)  as an electrician.
i love the end
Excelent video. Thanks a lot! 🙌
Software development is not about learning languages, that&#39;s very misleading video. The iceberg has a programming language of choice on top, and down go all the tools and technologies that build, test, deploy, and execute them.
Working with assembly make me question my existence...
I watch this bc the video is interesting while I know nothing about coding
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pEfrdAtAmqk&amp;t=551">9:11</a><br>carbon is in the future ?
Piet (from Piet Mondriaan) is pronounced Pete, not pee-ette. He wasn’t French. :P
I like how you&#39;re just casually throwing around chad and soy like they&#39;ve been in our lexicon for decades.
where matlab :0
As someone who&#39;s been programming for over 12 years and has at least dabbled with languages from almost every level of this iceberg,<br><br>This video reminded me I should learn Erlang
I hate Java.
Software Developer: 🤦‍♂
bbbbut, where&#39;s D lang?
You forgot about hardware description languages used to program FPGAs. Verilog, VHDL and SystemVerilog.
man here in Brazil we start with pascal
hmm, why did my university make the starting language for fundamentals of computer science DrRacket? That shit was so ass I&#39;m glad I probably don&#39;t have to see it ever again.
Not going to lie, I sometimes still miss the GOTO command in BASIC.
that ending shattered the very fabric of my reality
I still say, PROLOG needs to unalive itself
I haven’t watched the video yet, but I assume assembly must be number 1 from the bottom
&quot;Binary&quot;.... &quot;1679&quot; That got me.
on the last line you skipped the HDL and variants between assenbly and transistors
Thanks for the perspective view on the programming. Interesting for newbs like me. But you&#39;r not quite right about the philosophy
Glad to see smalltalk on the thumbnail.
HTML got a mention but Verilog and VHDL didn’t. That’s kinda sad.
At some point I thought that this video was a joke....
You left out HyperTalk
When I was studying computer science 20 years ago I had to create a new programming language for a class, and the compiler was written in Assembly. My compiler could generate computer graphics and even rendered bitmaps on the screen.
i pretty much stick to Python and C but been working with C++ and QT on a project with a friend in my spare time. I was never a Java fan tryed really hard to get into it but just was not for me.
I don’t mean to offend any programmers in here but isn’t using a garbage collector in your language just an admission that you don’t understand how your code works? If you do, you don’t need no stinking garbage collection.
15 sec in, assembly has to be at the bottom.
Is it bad im starting with C++?
Not mentioning Delphi is a criminal offense.
What? No VBA?
Wait, did he say, &quot;Soy-based languages&quot;? LOL.
After 12 year I create new computer language
Dude, Ruby dead. Please give some disclaimers before you waste people&#39;s time.
The funniest thing about this video is that I&#39;m in Uni for CS atm and we started learning with C# and after that we&#39;re learning C++😐
bro this video is sooo good...BUT AT LAST HE GOT REALLY LOST AND I AM LITERALLY LAUGHING HOW HE WENT TO QUESTION HIMSELF!!<br>🤣🤣
bro I literally know someone in my engineering program who printed the mandelbrot set on a .txt file with a c99 program
haha what was the ending tho
excuse me sir, what&#39;s a JSfuck? it seems like a very interesting and important things to learn 🤣🤣
Why did this get recommended to me
{wow}
I don&#39;t know why people forget SNOBOL4. It is for text processing and has more importance than you might realise.
You missed holy c
Where Assembler on your iceberg ?!
<b>Cries in VBA</b>
Best 16 minutes of mu life.😂
There is one layer you forgot: there is a field in computer science, that is all about making programming as complicated as possible.<br>They&#39;re designed such that writing a &quot;Hello World&quot; program might take years, because there are so many modulos, bit shifts, what-the-heck-do-I-know involved.<br>Maybe make the rule that every fibonacci-numberth-bit must be a zero. Cuz why not.
Take away lesson: Graze whatever languages you find appealing, then find one and master it. Otherwise you&#39;ll end up in a labyrinth of endless loops and quests.
Guys you should really look into the full story of Holy C. It gets wild.
What about CUDA and OpenCL??? O.o
Frontend Webdev Teacher here! If people say HTML is a programming language they&#39;re just wrong. It&#39;s in the damn name: Markup Language. And on it&#39;s own it&#39;s basically useless nowadays. You need at least a scripting language to make it do stuff and some stylesheets to make it sparkle.

Great video. Gave me a track to follow for years to come!
I thought I was going crazy that I heard some kid yelling in the background of this video.. but it is there <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pEfrdAtAmqk&amp;t=897">14:57</a> ... also one bit earlier but too lazy to go back.😂
You have to love to learn to do this job.  That&#39;s the overarching theme.  What you learned today will most likely become deprecated within a few years.  It&#39;s a job of constant evolution, so if you like to turtle this job is not for you.  You MUST change with the times or get left behind.  I went from C++ being the new thing in town with the MVC framework that Visual C++ gave you, to writing React front ends with Mulesoft SAPI, PAPI, and XAPI layers.  Mulesoft is getting old now, so I expect a new maverick to come on the scene and I have to learn a new dialect.  Once you understand programming from the core though, the other languages are pretty easy to pick up.  They all follow very similar patterns.  If you really want to stretch your wings, invent your own high level language, and write an interpreter and compiler/VM for that language.  That will help you understand that languages are just an abstraction to something else and it will make understanding new languages easier.
What about Clipper!? 🤣
delete this kufr I never accept it
Imagine making your own programming language, then just naming it a single letter (A lot of them on this list)
One of the best things about Rust is the absolute Chad of a compiler. Not only does it exactly tell you what went wrong and where it went wrong, it even tells you how to fix it.
me doing assembly in my first year of computer engineering and now searching most efficient ways to die on reddit.
Great content, but your editing style makes me feel out of breath.  A pause between sentences makes it easier to listen to.
well that escalated quickly
i love nim
but you can use call by reference in c++ (&amp;foo)
soy base languages
The next big coding language will be fundamentally based on how you can interact with and command an AI.
It has been my experience, dealing with dozens of different enterprise applications over the decades, that java applications are inevitably leaky and will crash. C applications are rock solid. I hate java so much that I will not even look at the source code, let alone learn it.

Genius!! so good.
I cant believe i can code until 8086 HAHAHAHAHA i reached the lowest level of the iceberg! but i still suck tho
must u use that useless thumbnail for your video
Hi<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>KTHXBYE
well its better to know what im getting into before senior high<br><b>cope</b>
Interestingly, I learned languages in a very chaotic order compared to the layers of your iceberg. Still, it&#39;s true that eventually, most programmers ends up hearing about all of them ^^<br><br>In high school I learned a bit of C++ thanks to an online course but got discouraged when they started using pointers a lot. I took a break to learn how to make static websites in HTML and CSS. I got really into LittleBigPlanet2 and its graphical programming system, even joining an open-source community and helping work on some popular libraries within the game. In parallel I made Ti-BASIC programs on my graphing calculator to help me with my homework, and started making game prototypes using Game Maker and GML.<br><br>While studying for a technical degree I was properly taught Visual Basic, C++, HTML, CSS, SVG, Java, PHP, SQL, SH, PowerShell, and taught myself JavaScript, Python and Dart. I also discovered esolangs and made a Piet interpreter as my final C++ project. JavaScript then became my favorite language because of how quickly I could get results with it (after a very tedious learning process, that I will admit), and because it allowed for a more declarative and functional style of programming.<br><br>Then I studied for a bachelor&#39;s degree and got better at the languages I already knew of while also learning SPARC assembly, Racket, C# and TypeScript and some more obscure ones like CommonLisp, B, SR, ACT-R. I also did a couple projects with the Unity game engine.<br><br>EDIT: and I started learned rust in my down time, and wow I&#39;m liking it.
I was interested in learning some basics just to ask chat gpt to build me some code but I&#39;m so far out of my wheel house. I&#39;m going to ask the guy in the chat to hire me as his farm hand.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pEfrdAtAmqk&amp;t=138">2:18</a> Thats Raju from 3 Idiots. 🤣🤣🤣
I have a technical electronics degree, which I&#39;ve got alongside high school. We learned binary and hexadecimals, then we learned basic logic gates... then C and Delphi (god, delphi is so bad). Then we went to intermediate/advanced logic gate projects. When I thought we were basically done, our last semester had us learn Assembly. I have nightmares to this day
You forgot about Perl and Delphi
OMNISSIAH BE PRAISED
anyone ever used IBM RPG?
Guys i learned how to plant carrots I&#39;m turning in to a farmer
I&#39;m about to recommend this to a friend who wants me to put her through becoming a developer.... lmao.
This video deserves its own programming language
This commentary is unlistenable. Why remove normal pauses between sentences it&#39;s not necessary!
chemistry
”Yoy don’t want to be on your death bed not having tried php” actually yes I do
The final tier reminds me of the short file &#39; Zima Blue&#39;
No Perl... :( I saw the camel, but no mention of it. I guess I can finally say I know how to program in a dead language.
No Objective-C mention? Or did I miss it?
oh no, i started from the bottom of the ocean that holds the entire iceberg...now i am going to the core of the planet 😢

A &quot;category&quot; is a collection of objects and arrows (or morphisms) between them, with some specific properties.<br>The statement &quot;A monad is just a monoid in the category of endofunctors&quot; means that a monad can be thought of as a special type of monoid that operates within the category of endofunctors, rather than in a set of elements.<br><br>In simpler terms, a monad is a way to describe a certain type of mathematical structure that has a binary operation and an identity element, but operates within a specific type of category.
Then there is English Language by ChatGPT in November 2022
and here I am, learning fortran 95. Fuck sake.
I am watching this because I took a 5 year long break from coding (amateur level) and forgot how to make &quot;Hello World&quot; program in Python :D
I&#39;m learning fortran and cobol languages at school right now as they are still in big use, I&#39;m sad on multiple levels, oh and dare i say turbo pascal is one of them
how long will it take to master 1 language? like python
How come you missed Perl?
Holy C
Then there are all the purposely insanely difficult ones that are made for the sole purpose of being as complicated as possible just for the lawls.
Oh holy hell
V deeper than rust you lost the plot my guy
I used all of the above mentioned programming languages at one point and time. Just kidding. Scratch and BASIC are my main ones.
I learned FORTRAN 77 first (in the 2010s...) and then taught myself Python out of anger.  I have to say having a bottom of iceberg and top of iceberg spread from the start has made it pretty easy to learn most things in-between.
i’m fu*ked bey i’m retiring it’s fu*king crazy this world i lose it in LOLCODE 😂😂😂
👎🏽
A Programming Language in 100 seconds!
Perfect outro 🍒
Hooray for solipsism! lmfao
I used to program in Assembly language (actually hex code) on my Apple //c. I made a Space Invaders like game and some automation stuff with sensors. Also made a light-pen input device. Then I fried the motherboard and it cost my parents a lot to get fixed. Good times.
Let me just learn Python in peace 😂
I love how none of these concepts were particuarly familiar to me until you got to philosophy, lol
We had to learn assembly in school. I&#39;m 19.
now i suggest you all to watch this video in 2x speed. you are welcome XD
This video is difficult to understand 😅
&quot;HTML is not a programming language&quot; oops, cancelled.    &quot;Always bet on JS&quot;  LOL!  <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pEfrdAtAmqk&amp;t=562">9:22</a> Contract S_coin!! Love it.   <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pEfrdAtAmqk&amp;t=640">10:40</a> I saw what you did with APL &quot;CC&quot; :D  Kudos for taking the time to also cover transistors.   That&#39;s fundamentally all we&#39;re doing, flipping switches.
All your videos are perfect.
LiveCode and Xojo were left out.

I made it to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pEfrdAtAmqk&amp;t=371">6:11</a> before throwing my hands in the air and saying f*ck it. How deep did yall get?
You expanded my understanding of programming, brought back memories, and made me laugh today.  Great writing!!
Thank you @Fireship for destroying my mind in this video🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣 I really really really know nothing🤣🤣🤣🤣

All the icebergs they look the same thats everything iceberg!
Where&#39;s Verilooooooggggg?!?!!
Wow. As a great lover of epistemology I am honoured to be considered at the deepest depths of the iceberg. Also I weirdly aspire to one day be able to understand and find use for APL. Gotta respect that terse language.
right around Brain*<b>*</b> is when I felt like my mind started to spiral and it was the best trip I have taken down any rabbit hole in a long time.

Well, I find it very funny, that I, who wrote ~100 lines of code in my entire life, am somehow related to or know something about that memes from all levels of middle iceberg at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pEfrdAtAmqk&amp;t=42">0:42</a>, and of course other two.<br>For the bottom layers of that middle one — I touched myself some lab equipment for testing radiation effects on different circuits and visited university chair where Ratushnyak works, and, supposedly, met him. <br>I always loved compression, even remember how in childhood (in age of 6-7 years) I tried to figure out how it works by myself, knowing only that it is possible and that information is stored in binary xd.
wow!..
Google and it&#39;s abortions. One of 10 things becomes a thing and when it does they abandon it.
the removal of semicolons and addition of tabbing is a malus for python.<br>python is a programming language for non programmers, and that&#39;s why it is slow.
First job was debugging APL ... Cardboard keyboard overlay to help input of special characters was a highlight ... Still have a headache lol
wow you forgot about PERL and GPL and J++ 01101100 01101111 01101100 6C6F6C
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pEfrdAtAmqk&amp;t=630">10:30</a> can confirm (learn Z/Os Cobol, the unix cobol is mostly worthless)
How did we go from python to intense philosophy?
Downvoted for censoring words.
Don’t forget Ada
I once built a calculator using only cables and logic gates. I can also easily count in binary, and somewhat count in trinary. I is cool?
PLEASE actually doesn&#39;t do anything but it makes you a polite programmer! <b>DEAD</b> 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Me who unironically started with C++: wow look at all these things i was supposed to do first! :D No wonder I wanted to bash my head on a mirror!
Great Video!
All of these programming languages but one have the same thing in common: they&#39;re all pointless alternatives to C.

I&#39;ve learnt how to program in the 80&#39;s in a MSX with exactly that same blue screen (same version, was built at that same year 1986, etc), oh boy, nostalgia did hit hard !<br>Before criticize the crudeness of the BASIC language one info: the Z80 processor ran at about 4 MHz (yes Mega not Giga a freaking 1000 times slower than today) and the machine had 64 KB of RAM.<br>I believe the most advanced language that I tried that could fit on those spartan specs was a Pascal compiler running on CP/M.
@<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pEfrdAtAmqk&amp;t=57">00:57</a> OMG I used the Rodney Zaks book back in the day!!
In 20 years, I went from Basic to C to HTML to PHP to Javascript to CSS to Java to Python and now Typescript. <br>Java is great for beginner not because it&#39;s easy to learn, it makes you a better programmer because it&#39;s quite strict and forces you to organise your thoughts. 80% of programming is thinking while 20% is writing code.
my uni made us go from python straight to C. it was rough
That escalated fast lol
I love how you started with Basic and finished with questioning reality :D
I loved this lol
Oh God please stop Python hype. Lack of typing and dependency management makes it a nightmare for large projects.

You inspired me to study Brainf***. Where are the tutorials though?
Simple syntax does not necessarily mean simple software development. I&#39;d rather have the higher-level abstractions of C++ as compared to C.

HTML isn’t coding. Neither is xml. They’re just groups of data denoted by tags. It’s a markup language, it’s in its own name.
I think the best place to start is 6th form calculus and physics
and then there&#39;s ChatGPT on top of it
Not pictured: domain specific languages. You start with GPU shader languages and end up somewhere much more weird.
You forgot VHDL.

I really hope someone makes a full video game from the COD Zombies format. Waw to Black ops 2 was great but zombies went stagnant and even went downwords after black ops 2.  Someone needs to make bigger zombies maps with a more accesable mission instead of those hard to do easter eggs.  I truely beleive an upgraded form of COD zombies would perform well as a standalone game.
Fuck that was interesting.

Everything just ought to use Perl to be sufficiently DEEP. So deep you skipped it even though the camel logo was shown on the level of  APL, Pascal and COBOL.
As a CS person, prolog is as deep as I went

Hello the matrix
A relative of mine had to use assembler for his work. He said on a good day, he was able to write 2 lines of functional code with it. And he said it&#39;s extremely powerful for it&#39;s efficiency when it runs.<br>I certainly hope i&#39;ll never have to do that. Allthough i really want to learn and understand it.
As a product designer/manager not coming from a CS background this is soooo helpful. I know HTML and CSS from my tumblr days. and took some Javascript classes, but.... Question for any devs reading this: If I&#39;m working on mobile/web app projects, which language I should I learn about next to be the most helpful to a wide variety of devs?
i feel like, you missed a &quot;programming language&quot; between assembly and transistors, vhdl would be somewhere betwwen there
You need to do a video on the DNA programming language
assembler is actually very fun
you earned my thumbs up right at the end there buddy.
It&#39;s good to hear about Assembly again. I used Assembly to program a 8-bit microcontroller years ago, and i enjoyed it. Made my life with JavaScript way easier.
What about &quot;Rockstar&quot; lang?
My brain is just 0&#39;s and 1&#39;s now. Thank You @Fireship
ahaha masterpiece !
Software Engineer for &gt;20 years. HTML &amp; CSS is a markup language. HTML &amp; CSS is as much a programming language as Google Docs is a programming language ;)  There I said it, bring on the flaming!
Most of these languages lead to dead end jobs. Learn the most popular ones to make the most money:    <br>HTML, CSS, and JS. I suggest you go Web 3  crypto with M0t0k0, which is used by lCP, which is the fastest and most secure and decentralized crypto in the world. It is the only one  that can link up with Web 2 without oracles, and with other cryptos without bridges. Forget about Solidity for Eth, which has most of its servers based in the centralized cloud.<br>If you want to go no code programming, use Backendless with Appgyver for the front end.
As a Software Engineering student who did a semester of philosophy before IT, that epistemology bit hit me so hard.
hello can someone tell me what did he mean by &quot;always bet on JS&quot; at the end? can someone explain the joke please.

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pEfrdAtAmqk&amp;t=247">4:07</a> Once you understand how Java types works, you can&#39;t get enough, i absolutely love it. By the way i think there&#39;s one level missing between ASSEMBLY and Transistors, microcode of the CPU
thanks that is cool
I can&#39;t get over the esoteric languages. I mean, what the??!<br>As if this wasn&#39;t what it is already, people actually went out of their way to do that???<br>Too much free time, that&#39;s what they have.<br><br>Dang!
Is it sad I only know the bottom of the iceberg? C++ and transistors.

I was hoping to see Verilog and VHDL at the base of the iceberg
Hey, great video, but am I missing something? I am from Denmark myself so I just want to fact-check this part of the video; C++ was a Danish invention, and not an American invention, right? Maybe it was published in the USA??? Please correct me.<br>From wikipedia: &quot;C++ (pronounced &quot;C plus plus&quot;) is a high-level general-purpose programming language created by Danish computer scientist Bjarne Stroustrup as an extension of the C programming language, or &quot;C with Classes&quot;.&quot;<br><br>I feel kinda scammed by him if he didn&#39;t invent C++, as I have been to &quot;talkshows&quot; with Bjarne Stroustrup...<br>@Fireship

Typescript dev here, currently learning the modern chad(rust) as I will now call it.
we used to program microcontrollers with assembly lenguage in highschool. A few years ago I tried to start programming again with newer lenguages and I felt overwhelm by not having control over the processor banks of memory, clock, etc. I was unsure of everything beacause I didn&#39;t feel in control so I got scared and walk away. Then I try again and a friend tought me how to use C to program microcontrollers. Now I&#39;m learning C# with unity but I still preffer assembly 🤣
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pEfrdAtAmqk&amp;t=896">14:56</a> am i insane or is there screaming in the background

I&#39;m still at the surface of the iceberg and my brain is already fried 💀
Assembly should be at the bottom on its own before binary
People. Don&#39;t listen to this Drama Queen.<br>You can do everything in one language.<br>I&#39;ve been doing APL for 50 years.<br>Again, fireship is just an alarmist Drama Queen trying to get clicks.<br>Ignore her.
If you think blowing your leg off in C++ is bad, just give Fortran a try. It&#39;s as easy to discharge as C and each shot is even more deadly than C++. And yes, it&#39;s still widely used in several fields of applied physics.
it all returns to nothing
For non-tech people who find this video, he uses some terms that might not fully make sense to people who haven’t heard them before, such as:<br>Low level language: lower level languages are closer to machine code. The lower it is, the less “human readable” it is. Obviously people still code with these languages, but really low level stuff like assembly just looks like a bunch of random crap to people who don’t know it.<br>High level language: on the flip side, these are languages that are further removed from machine language. More “human readable” and easier for even the lay person to look at and be like “oh, yeah I can kinda see the logic flow”. Stuff like Python where they replace some logical operators with words and such, are very “high level”. The joke ones like Chef would be even more high level since it is literally sentences.<br><br>Hope this helps. I didn’t notice any other lingo, but I’m so used to hearing it I may have just not noticed
You really fucked my brain 🧠🎇
by your standars God is the ultimate programmer working with quantum logic at sub-atomic particle level.

All roads end up at epistemology. Great!
meh id rather coders spend a little more time designing apps in languages and stacks they do know rather than failing at everything equally. youd be surpised how much codes looks cool but utterly fails in production, or works but doesnt scale
why no RPG

Is this voice computer generated? I really hate how there&#39;s no gaps at all where a human would pause for half a second to take a break.
I was going to say that the year of origin for Machine Code was off a bit, not in the 1970s but 1950s, however I watched again and now I see - the year is 1679, went by very fast and I had misinterpreted it as a more familiar 1970-something.   But it&#39;s 1679, and it&#39;s all about Binary, invented or published by Leibniz in that year, give or take a few depending on what sources you read.  <br><br>Maybe.  Herbert Bruderer in an article in Communications of the ACM points out that John W. Shirley a few decades ago pointed out that &quot;...the mathematical papers of Thomas Hariot (1560–1621) show clearly that Harriot not only experimented with number systems, but also understood clearly the theory and practice of binary numeration nearly a century before Leibniz&#39;s time.&quot;   <br><br>So maybe this video needs an update?
Unless I blinked and missed it, was there no mention of the greatest language in the world, D?  (I may be biased, having just wrote a little useful tool in D.)   <br><br>And what about Forth?  Postscript?   And those obsolete Pascal-flavored languages, Modula and Oberon? And for a brief time in 1997, I looked at Sather - a language few have ever heard of. <br><br>At least one of my other favorites did get mentioned, Crystal, and I liked Haxe a few years ago.  <br><br>To be fair, it goes the other way too - languages mentioned that I never heard of.  V is one.  Recently I found out that in the world of C++ successors/alternatives, there&#39;s one called Vale and one called Val.  And I use Vala, which is great for working on gtk, gobject based software.   V, Vala, Vale, Val - what is going on with the &quot;V&quot; names?

In the bit about transistors, you should have mentioned Verilog, which is a programming language people who design hardware use to produce transistor schematics without having to draw out millions of microscopic transistors on paper like the used to have to do
Me after learning html : welp good let&#39;s make website<br>me after learning php : ugh gonna fix this css<br>Me after learning Laravel &amp; SQL : HELP ME!<br>ME after seeing bunch of code programing in this video : ughh I&#39;am gonna throw up 🤢🤢🤮

I&#39;ve been interested and always enjoyed programming as a hobby.. but as a kid I didn&#39;t care enough about my future and just skipped school as much as possible (called in sick, did the very bare minimum, etc..)<br><br>Ended up &quot;graduating&quot; highschool without a complete diploma. Then at 22 y/o I realized I should have focused up back then and actually gotten good grades and graduated so that I could go to uni and study computer science.. instead im stuck at 25 doing shit I really don&#39;t care about at all.
man forgot about HDL (hardware description languages) that are used to to describe the structure and behavior of electronic circuits like VHDL and Verilog most electrical engineers learn them
Holy C
this video did make me confused more. but good video bro. lol !!!
This is not a roadmap. It’s an overview !<br>Fellow programmers, pick one programming language and then start making money as soon as possible! <br><a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23business">#BUSINESS</a> 😅

The best language to get a job as a programmer is stackoverflow. Also, I worked in Insurance tech and can confirm that there are about to be a whole lot of vacancies opening up for Cobol positions given the average age of all Cobol programmers I have seen, give it a few years...
Basic is cool. “Go to” is underrated
Once got down to logic gates... ya missed vhdl...
You did an awesome job of brainfu<a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23k">#k</a> !!
i do not know if I wanted to become aware of the bottom of the iceberg 8o !
Yep, the end of that I was totally not expecting, but fits in with the rest of it perfectly
Stupidity successfully installed
Why is the guy in the thumbnail smoking a splif? XD
I&#39;m actually surprised ladder logic didn&#39;t make the list since it&#39;s used in a lot of industrial machinery. Then you have Karel and Pascal&#39;s baby that&#39;s used for robotics.
Well,programming isn&#39;t my lifestyle
I lost my job at Vice so I’m here trying to learn what to code.
Me, an ABAP developer 💅
I thought  Linux was a  programming language
Bruh where is redstone?
ha amateurs i use notepad !!!
You are mad
Wait, C came in 1972. Where did he he get a reference for 1969 ?
&quot;Any application that can be written in javascript, will eventually be written in javascript&quot;<br>I disagree, since we now have web assembly.
Glad c++ was the first language I was taught at university then if it&#39;s supposedly the hardest. It didn&#39;t seem that difficult either but I had a lot of help from the lecturer. I think maybe people find it difficult because they started with a different langauge and then tried to learn C++ as a second. I think when you don&#39;t know anything about programming at all it&#39;s kinda easy cus you have no basis for whats difficult lol.
You missed RTL languages. 😞
Last part destroyed my today’s motivation
Thank you, I have looked into ELM because I like the idea of it but the Syntax and Structure blew me off at first but at I started to like it. Exciting :) Thx!!
This video is gold
At the end AI will do everything and programmers will no longer exist!
Where is MATLAB??
This makes me so happy!!! It gave me an ego trip that i did NOT need...
it was intense
The Ron Turing away from JS 😂😂 perfect.
i thought this was an informative vid but instead i was laughing
The number of languages alone turned me off from programming. Things are much simpler working at a help desk.
[cue everyone foaming from the mouth and twitching having a seizure on the ground by the iceberg’s depth]
It&#39;s a small thing, but I really like how he tags in philosophy specifically epistemology at the end without any derision as the &quot;lowest&quot; point of CS. I know its partly in jest, but in STEM I see a lot of people shit on philosophy even though its foundational to literally everything.
In my Micro 1 class, on our exam we had to write C on paper, and then translated into ARM Assembly. Pretty easy… (that was a lie)
Emojicode is bad but its still better than the emoji movie
wrote some lines in almost all mentioned languages, time to move into philosophy.
You forgot to mention that V is vaporware.
The last minute is my favorite. Great intro into the different levels
im using lua im in middle school its pretty easy so far
Java, c#, and c++ are too deep in. If you study at university you&#39;ll probably take one of those as an intro course
I’m a fan of Human Languages, I pick them up relatively quick but programming ones are easy as hell to learn but if you don’t apply yourself it’s tough. I need to apply myself cause my coding journey isn’t going too well.
I know the basics of Python and now I know how much I don&#39;t know
Lol Piet is  pronounced as Pete not Pè-ét……I pissed myself you made Piet sound like a fancy french name 😂😂😂
Bruuh this vidéo is so discouraging 😂😂😂
I had no idea what half of the words you said meant, but it was very interesting.
WOW isn&#39;t lua, it&#39;s C++ for sure, only interface modding on lua
Ayahuasca trip.... damn man I&#39;ve had that feeling my self.
Me an absolute chad who codes solely in Assembly: &quot;peasants&quot;
ah, when we start getting into the realm of assembly and machine code i ask myself, why do I bother buying shoes, I should just make them myself, from salvaged potato peels with home brewed glue &amp;&amp; paint
I know basic, assembly, c++, and a bit of html. I&#39;ve never done anything in python.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pEfrdAtAmqk&amp;t=417">6:57</a> - did I hear correctly, did he just call all the other languages &quot;soy-based&quot;? 😂
developed a fever a one weeks headache after watching this video. I am ready to be mad! lets go!!
THAT. WAS. 🍉
Just started a software engineer degree. Is it normal to feel like an absolute idiot not knowing wtf is going on?
why the fuck, my college taught me assembly. It don&#39;t make any sense.
FireShip: your name really suits the video. Thank you for the entertainment.  The country and date stamps were what kept me engaged. Cheers!
he&#39;s the average redditer,  but he actually did what said he would do
If all your languages can represent Mandelbrot set <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pEfrdAtAmqk&amp;t=33">0:33</a> ,  you are still at the tip of the iceberg (looking at you - total functional programming)
Holy C I liked this video
No FPGA programming?
As someone relatively new to programming I feel like I&#39;m watching something in another language
the pointers joke 😂
Oh God
Bas kar bhai
But how do I get a job
When will we get Fireship Language?
The ending of this video is my exact thought process whenever trying to solve a problem, what even is knowledge? What am i?
then there is visual basic, then there is blueprint,, then there is excel, then there is office macros, then there is webbrowser macros, then there is dna, then there is rna, then there is neurons

Iceberg&#39;s within iceberg&#39;s within iceberg&#39;s, woah...
my brain melted
Fascinating.  Thanks.
I got my IT degree back in 2010, and have been working away from the development field for 8 years now. This video is a massive eye-opener as to just how much has changed in that time.
Hate letters, numbers, and symbols? Easy, program with Whitespace.
My first programming experience took place  in 1985. I was bout 15 years old. We had a Texas instruments TI-99/4A computer, which came with BASIC. Then in 1989 I started college and took up Fortran and Turbo Pascal. I&#39;ts been a long long way!
tl;dr: What doth life?
This was a fun rabbit hole. This only lead me to ask: What is &quot;is&#39;?
You have gone toooooooooo dddddeeeep
Now it&#39;s AI
my teacher insisted students should start with Java as their first programming language , I felt like it&#39;d turn away new programmers who never touched code before but it also trained us on debugging thoroughly
As a brazillian, im surprised by the capacity of my people to create languages.
i am from czechia <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pEfrdAtAmqk&amp;t=278">4:38</a>
HTML is not a program language it&#39;s a interpreter language!
You didn&#39;t understand modern epistemology.
Well, everyone is arguing about languages, but it is not language which is important. It how you use them.
This makes perfect sense.... now I know why I prefer C# over C++ .... because I&#39;m a belligerent fool unworthy of my degree and I should stick to developing calculators in Unity.   Fantastic.
wow, I can&#39;t believe some of these exist
Before epistemology you had to say neuroscience
I&#39;ve been wondering for the last two months whether I needed college at all bc I knew if I put in enough time, I could already work in software, but I want the university experience anyway. I&#39;ll be turning this on sometime during CS college when I&#39;m depressed by my life choices to remind me that there are still people in the world who can make me hysterically laugh while watching a programming video
the last 5 minutes of this video are absolutely bonkers

Bhailang OP
Best video ever made 😂
the greatest knowledge is that you know nothing
well that escalated quickly
I dunno man it&#39;s all so weird<br>Like how does any thing even exist?<br>Always bet on JS, you&#39;ll never lose
I watched the whole video to heard about the Rust. I made my hand dirty with the Rust recently.

Great video, amazing compilation of knowledge in just 16 minutes!<br>However, C++ was created by the Danish computer scientist Bjarne Stoustrup and was standardized through an ISO.
&quot;How we&#39;re going to name this new programming language?&quot;<br><br>-APL!!!!<br><br><br><br><br><br>A programming language
a funny story I know Assembly language programming finding it difficult to learn python

very detailed explanation. Where would you place LiveCode, and what are your thoughts on it?
I learned Pascal, C++, and Python. Now all i need is ChatGPT.
whatta hell is that, c--
After this video, I want to change my job (web developer)
My college is weird and taught us coding in MatLab. I&#39;m teaching myself c# and did a bit of python too, but I still know ML best
Barely passed my c++ class by the skin of my teeth. never programmed before in my life before that (intro, 100-level) class. Had to take a CS class for my actuarial sciences major, but I&#39;m never taking c++ again. I&#39;m glad to see its down the iceberg a bit so I&#39;m not so alone in my struggle
Literal dumpster fire of a video. You forgot TI-Basic, a super dumbed-down, absolute piece of shit of a language that no one should learn because you can build better things in assembly. The funny part is that on the calulator itself, you can access more memory through assembly than with TI-Basic even though you are using the same IDE and parameters.
Perhaps you have a passion for embedded device design (medical equipment, robots, weather stations/sensors, automotive control, security systems).  You&#39;ll be developing firmware for the ARM variants, PIC32, AVR, etc.  Think kilobytes of RAM and up to 1M bytes of program memory.  &quot;C&quot; is king in this space and in most cases the compiler is freely available.  Sometimes C++ is available.  A step up from there is the Raspberry Pi, NVIDIA Jetson, and ASUS Tinker Board; quite a few more programming languages are available.
How dare you call HTML a programming language ;)
Wait c++ is danish right?
A.G.I Will be man&#39;s last invention

That was fun to watch and now to my psychiatrist appointment
Awesome, accurate, and very fun! Thanks Fireship~
why didnt you include erlang or haskell? wtf
I couldn&#39;t figure out java. My professor told me I wasn&#39;t a good fit for computer science. People kept telling me it was because he taught exclusively in java for the 101 course and later taught C. I just thought I wasn&#39;t smart enough. <br><br>H-uh
Structured Text and Ladder Logic plus other PLC languages are widely used to control machines and in high demand
The Deeper I went, exciting it got 😵‍💫
Cool video! Btw, &#39;Piet&#39; is pronounced virtually identically to the English name &#39;Pete&#39;. &#39;ie&#39; is a compound vowel in Dutch which is always pronounced the way &#39;ee&#39; is usually pronounced in English. Saves the Dutch from having to add that weird silent -e at the end of Pete.
Insightful

Basic, what everyone learns in high school or atleast used to.<br>SQL, what everyone teaches them selfs because its a joke how easy it is<br>C# what everyone hates but eventually learns just to put it on a resume<br>Bash, what try hards use to mod games or create 3rd party programs <br>Java. what op hackers use to fk with people. they hate everyone and everything including themselfs<br>HTML what your mother or grandmother learned to host that one website on GeoCities<br>PowerShell, because fk everyone and every other language
Socrates 💯
I learned OOP on LPC, created by a graduate student for the purpose of developing MUD. Back in the 90&#39;s, in was a more powerful and higher performance language than Java, so I was not impressed with Java when I started learning that in college. C/C++/C# were much better languages and easier to learn after my background in LPC.
well, that was an unexpected ending
I started as c++ programmer.
This video sent me into a spiral
haha imagine learning assembly before python in engineering college
This went from programming to exurb1a really fast.
I usually program in: Java, C++, C#, Javascript and of course HTML, CSS and MYSQL for web development lol
my school be like: Isn&#39;t programming cool? <br>Yes.<br>Ok nice. Here is C++ have fun learning it, test is in two weeks.
yeah that&#39;s why you never go from the high level to the low level, you always start in a level and go up from there, otherwise... you end up questioning your own existence
that was the best conclusion to this video that there ever could have been
Perl?
Ah yes the lowest programming language: brain
I had to learn assembly in university, so i could program a microcontroller from the 80s.
I inherited a Pascal application. Last time I used Pascal was in the late 80s-early 90s in my high school programming class. And the person who wrote it put all procedures in one file.
What&#39;s funny is the top of the iceburg looks just as confusing from the bottom. Having learned C and assembly first, it&#39;s more frustrating to sift through libraries and docs than just solve problems. Also, you never dropped the Verilog bomb. The layer below Assembly is HDLs. Instead of coding directly on the machine, you code the machine itself.
I did C++ at Uni for 2 years, I winged it somehow. At the end of the course I had very little idea of what C++ was, or how to use it.<br>15 years later, I actually completed a C++ tutorial book and was most proud with myself, I had a better understanding. I thought; this it is baby, I am going to get a programming job, then I discovered the iceberg and my hopes and dreams were somewhat dashed. Today, My mind is not as agile, shall we say. I shy away from complexity. I just want a simple life. I will leave the complexed challenges to those who love mental masterbation.
hahahaha wooooow! What an amazing video, bro! Appreciate it some much! You are my dear brother whoever you are ;)
holly C sounds like a good choice for a religion, i&#39;m wonder how the bible would looks like
I&#39;m so inspired!!! <br>Holy C..  😂

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pEfrdAtAmqk&amp;t=872">14:32</a> RIP Terry
lol the ending
brooooooooooo
Actually this is not a roadmap. What he did, he just mentioned what he heard so far..... He doesn&#39;t know about practicality.
Not sure I&#39;d put everything in this structure for the ice burg.  The first language i learned was a variant of asm.  From there, I learned common lisp and c/C++.  Then I picked up python for scripting and worked with a large swath of languages in the enterprise domain.  Right now, I write most things in elixir and rust (both pair up really nicely via NIFs).  On occasion, I&#39;ll also use c and lisp as well as dart for mobile.  When I am forced to write front-end code, my weapon of choice is clojurescript or elm (though these days I use reason/bucklescript over elm).<br><br>Stay away from v; they claim so many things, but the compiler has tons of holes in it.
I think that ending was completely unnecessary but good video
Started with C at high school and then C++. At university only C and then some Python for project they didn’t taught us because “it is easy”. So even at the end of my studies I never learned in reality to program in Python, when I need something I search on internet end everything works. I program better in C than in Python, and I prefer to use pointer and do extremely powerful stuffs in C rather than use Python which for me is like a toy language 😮
Fact: Programming Language came way before computers.
please turn off my laptop if i di
Imagine if we were all chads like Bjarne Straustrup
Xd The first language i learned is c sharp
Sad that you didn&#39;t mention hardware description languages, after all, they are a major part of CS/CE world, and stands right between ASM and logic gates
The neglect of VBA makes me sad as a VBA veteran
I&#39;ve learned x86 and x64 assembly for reverse engineering and these logic gates for electronic. Being sincere, it is not that hard, but you must to have a lot of knowledge about computers, memory management and so on and be able to map many information on your brain at the same time. <br><br>Today I am a 18 years old man and an entrepreneur starting a cybersecurity company.
It got really deep at the end.
With programming, the more you learn, the less you know.
thought people were in my house, just talking in the background of the audio, scared now.
HTML is NOT a programming language. Full stop. Its a markup language.
Scratch sucks
that became dark pretty soon
Horrible video. I&#39;ll know to tell anyone I know to steer clear of Jeff Delaney for coding education.
I kinda wanna make my own programming language now... using macros in C. Chef sounds great
Best part was the ending philosophy
As an electrical engineer I warn you : DO NOT ENTER THE LAST LEVEL , IT&#39;S NOT WORTH YOUR SANITY!!
I reached the bottom level when I was 18.. it made paying attention in my physics tutorials difficult as I didn&#39;t know if logic or mathematics had any basis in reality...<br>Also I learned Brainfuck before Javascript. Yeah I&#39;m a weirdo lol.
Knew a guy in college that could code in brainfuck.  He was weird.
I just wanna learn dart and call it a day
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pEfrdAtAmqk&amp;t=633">10:33</a> I taught myself COBOL a decade ago, as we had hired a team lead experienced in it. (He was an architect for state government infrastructure.) I thought it was interesting how different it looked, and had macro’d out most of my workday at that point.<br><br>Today, I get the most boomer Web 1.0-Gen recruiter messages. If you ever want to troll, just say you know COBOL, Fortran, (and Fivetran. :) )
Damn, I&#39;m a beginner and started with java.
RIP Terry A. Davis. The greatest programmer that have ever lived.
The last 2 minutes be like <b>That escalated quickly</b>
I love this video. Thank you.

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pEfrdAtAmqk&amp;t=945">15:45</a><br> I like that Cable Guy reference
I actually met a guy recently who used to work in binary. He said that most people who know binary went insane and are in the nuthouse 💀💀💀 he was joking but to even make that kind of a joke you have to have experienced some real brain fucking. <br>Also he no longer owns a computer and lives on a houseboat.
No Whitespace? <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whitespace_(programming_language)">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whitespace_(programming_language)</a>

I love this video so much
C-- is far from esotheric, it&#39;s used at one of Haskell compilation stages (by GHC at least)<br>The list lacks Forth, cell automatons (rule 110), lambda-calculus, combinatory languages (like SKI-basis, iota and jot), and the whole class of proof assistents (Agda/Epigram/Coq/Idris/Lean etc.) which are programming langs too
If you are a brazilian, Lua will always be a gigachad for you even if you haven&#39;t coded a single line in it

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pEfrdAtAmqk&amp;t=47">0:47</a> &quot;Learning how to code from SCRATCH.&quot;
Chef doesn&#39;t look silly now.
If you are on the noob level but want to go all the way down to logic gates there&#39;s a course for that called Nand 2 Tetris.<br><br>It starts with high-level electronics design (start with NAND gate, don&#39;t lay anything out on chips, but design the connections and main architecture), then goes from the bottom of the iceberg to about middle. Memes aside I do highly recommend it. I&#39;ve been coding before taking it, it was not super hard but I did break some sweat, since than I have an understanding of how all of this fits in and what ACTUALLY happens after typing print(&quot;Hello World&quot;) clicking compile and run. Before that I had no clue except for knowing bare definition of Von Neumann architecture.
you forgot about CSS and HTML, didnt you ? 😂😂😂
I only code in Holy C, just as St. Davis intended
You forgot matlab, but i guess it is very much like Julia
I miss working on old crap like AMOS basic and general basic on Amiga&#39;s  in the late 80s early 90s..  😁
It&#39;s so funny to me that people are always chasing the shiny new language then they get out of school and all of the job listings are looking for COBOL and Java because the old tech companies refuse to update their legacy systems. Anyway this video was a masterpiece, especially that ending. I&#39;m always trying to tell people that meaning isn&#39;t inherent in the universe!
That WAS SOOOOOO GOOOOD😍😍😍😍😂😂😂😂
I&#39;m still thinking how the video ends. 😅 Brain 🙏👍
Skip to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pEfrdAtAmqk&amp;t=50">0:50</a>
The first programming language I learned in College was Java, (hated it cause my professor held my hand through the whole thing so when i got into advance level java programming, it was hard and had to relearn it twice) then i learned HTML, CSS, and Java Script. (that was a lot of fun) after that I learned SQL and promptly forgot about it. Then I graduated, Started to learn python on my own, got distracted, and was certified in Ruby.  Now I&#39;m learning Stick.<br><br><br><br><br>as in stick welding.

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pEfrdAtAmqk&amp;t=698">11:38</a> I physically recoiled at this part. I F***ING HATE PROLOG with a BURNING PASSION
another language that came out this year... but has 1958 attached wtf???
Abap all the way
When &quot;YOURSELF&quot; dropped I broke down. Leading to my first ever comment on this very famous website Youtube.
You skipped over the FPGA languages a bit... stuff like Verilog HDL, SystemVerilog, and VHDL.  You did say logic gates, but these languages are a bit more than just the gates.  The conceptually difficult part of &#39;programming&#39; with them is always keeping in mind that everything basically happens at the same time, that your code is not executed line by line per se.
What do you mean &#39;please&#39; doesn&#39;t do anything?  My understanding is that the code doesn&#39;t work if you aren&#39;t polite, and also doesn&#39;t work if you&#39;re excessively polite.  So it makes it work :P
What he says about Cobol is totally correct, it&#39;s the reason my university started teaching Cobol again (demand for devs from corporations).
I mostly just C, and dabble in C++.  But C does do some object oriented stuff to a degree... structs and classes are literally identical except that classes default to private and structs to public.  Also... the pointer and memory management are totally a major part of C, in fact you have to do it in C more than in C++.  The trouble in C++ is that you can cause all sorts of other confusion.  Oh, and macros suck.  If you&#39;re ever even thinking of using macros, then you&#39;re doing it wrong, quit coding now.
Seems straightforward enough...why do I smell smoke?
Basically you can see that it is not an iceberg... But different tools for different purposes, don&#39;t get scared by this video, if you like programming do a favor to yourself and keep practicing everyday.<br><br>I&#39;m a software developer that started from nowhere, after 7 years I&#39;m already living in another country and have a good life. I&#39;m not rich, but I&#39;m happy and have a comfortable life. And I study programming almost everyday.<br><br>My main language is Python, I&#39;ve been through C, C++, Lua and Go, but what brought me here was my capability of solving problems, not the languages that I know, for that, there are documentation and courses.<br><br>Stay hungry...
I will only take the advice given at the end of the video and bet on JS, to never lose.
Learning prolog in 2021 was fantastic
Ansi C FTW. (Yeah &#39;m old :D)
That book from Rodney Zacks was my very first programming textbook...
Wtf? In romania we start learning to code with c or c++ depending on your highschool but aparently they&#39;re  one of the hardest coding languages???????<br>Hell is a state of mind

Where is Verilog and VHDL?
at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pEfrdAtAmqk&amp;t=520">8:40</a> is that your family shouting, lol.
Thinking about starting with COBOL. I feel like the payoff would be worth it
ada is my first and last love
Thank for this great video.<br>I missed &quot;Ponylang&quot; though...
Dart is also functional language
Cant we just use English
The biggest feature of Lisp is user definable syntax since the syntax is made of Lists which can be manipulated before evaluation. You can grow the language from a handful of primitive forms and keep growing it to meet your problem space.
You covered sooo many languages, but you missed FORTH which was huge in the 1970&#39;s and 1980&#39;s especially in control systems. The big daddy was polyFORTH (USA)

You wasted 2.8M X 10 minutes single handedly .. approximately
Is LabVIEW considered a programming language?
The only language that I hate you missed in the “final” tier is any of the HDLs such as Verilog or VHDL.
hlo developers
I stopped at 9 minutes. Like wtf. To hell with coding. I&#39;m gonna go work on my mix tape and be a rapper instead.
Appearently you nevert about FORTH which makes your overview - still nice - but incomplete ;-)
Dumpster fire is a great insult
Thankfully I&#39;ve stopped programming career and become a farmer with a some automation with my Raspberry Pi and my beloved Free Pascal. No more stupid and painful to read Javascript and Python codes with their new libraries and framework for every week. Love Object Pascal, it just works, fast compile time, fast run time, compile anywhere, even for JVM or even transpile to JS, and easy to understand, like typing a poem, Object Pascal is the best. Just me, my rice field and Free Pascal. What a beautiful life in a countryside without a noisy office and endless new framework learning.
OMG++
War is behind soft ice programs.<br>?? SafeL bar.<br>Life base in a safeLhat bar.
I actually really enjoy low level languages. I remember in college doing Assembly for a project and finding it really really satisfying.
your video saved my life
HTML is not a programming language.  I programmed for over 40 years and retired, so I cancelled myself.  HTML, CSS and JavaScript together make a programming language.
Ok, things escalated pretty quickly at the end... 😞
okay a good video
does esoteric mean a complete degenerate?
one of the best programming vids ive seen in my entire life  😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
I like php very much
Meanwhile, companies still be looking for a full stack devs that are straight outta college 🤣
Forgot Objective-C
somebody want to explain to me why the JS abomination showed at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pEfrdAtAmqk&amp;t=117">1:57</a> assigns the value &#39;fail&#39; to x.... why.... just... why...
You made a very interesting and informative video. Really fun to watch. Until <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pEfrdAtAmqk&amp;t=975">16:15</a> when you spread poop everywhere with this Kant BS.<br>&quot;Reality only exists within your own mind&quot;? Wow. I hope your mind never stops working otherwise all things will disappear.<br>&quot;The external world is illusions and projections&quot;?  No need to look both sides before crossing the street then.<br>You make good videos, but you suck at philosophy.
I didn’t hear anything Ajax
Everytime I think I know something well, I watch this video to humble myself.
if you’re going to program, you’ll use python, anyways, i have some tips for some script commands in python<br>1. print(), prints any object or value of the variable, variables are stuff that you custom that can have orders names, and values, so print() only prints text only if you dont use “”. If u use “” in the () and put inside text, it’ll actually make text.<br>2. import time, chose import time, because it’s the simplest way to delay control flow, which is REALLY useful, it basically allows you to use time.sleep() which you can put a number inside the (), if you do so, it’ll delay that amount of numbers, it’s like putting the number in and it converts it in to seconds.<br>3. time.sleep(), like 2, if you put the number amount in the (), it’ll take it as seconds, and delay that amount of seconds.<br><br>and if you are stuck with what IDE using, i recomend Visual Studio Code, because its the most understandable out there, watch a tutorial how to download that, it has extensions, even python! So i recomend Visual Studio Code more than any one else.<br>If you want to program and have a IDE, i recomend Python if you want to take it low level, or if you have more things to program, i recomend lua. both downloadable in extensions!
HTML is NOT a programming language, it is (like the name hypertext MARKUP LANGUAGE says) a markup language. HTML is NOT turing complete, it is only a way to represent data.
Aight, f*{k this shit! Lol
THANK U BOSS!
I dont&#39; think Irony means what you think it means.
This is one of the best videos on programming I&#39;ve seen on this platform. That monad joke was perfect - even if you fully understand them, good luck explaining it to anyone else.
Why did you mention Vietnam at the end though? LOL, is it just random or ?
i think im gonna stick with english
me watching this video, only knowing the some of the languages at the top of the iceberg: Tf is this?
Scratch is RAD. Garbage
Challenge accepted
The bad thing about this video is that you can&#39;t erase it from your mind to rewatch like the first time, until Elon Musk launchs that feature with the Neuralink
As a ABAP developer I always feel sad being left out.
Lol GO a high performance language. It is ionly high comapred to python. it is still slugish compared to C++ and Rust
I always said that the label full stack developer is absurd. A full stack developers would need to at bare minimum be able to  write his own operatign system, compiler,  drivers, the browser itself, the data base (write it, not use it), the protocols, then only the easy stuff of backend and frontend.
&quot;BHAI LANG&quot; not mentioned
I did not expect this to go lower than logic gates, the one following it made me audibly ask &quot;What?&quot;
I&#39;ve always been a huge fan but after this video I turned into an air conditioner
i only knew haxe in modern languages
Always disappointed when I don&#39;t see RPG included in these lists lol. Then again, it is a platform specific language
wait you can make a mandelbrot set in Lua? there is no visual representation
Wow i feel so motivated to not try to this anymore : )
I was thinking &quot;Another bro-science BS list.&quot;  Then you got to the final minute and won my sub.  Legendary!
Programming - Not even once!
He put Perl on the list, but have not talked about it, so we would think about it! Well played.
There are other programming languages ​​besides C
Watching a video about programming to help decide what language to use and end up having an existential crisis... Yeah, this is just my typical day.
How about Perl!?
A job that pays you well to die sitting at the computer fulfilling someone&#39;s dreams. And yes, a few start their own businesses, and most of those fail.
Machine language and Assembly Language are hardest because you&#39;re directly talking to the computer. And if you messed up a register you fucked up.
Am i the only one or do others also feel that programming is scary
Minimum Description Length theorem might blow up your mind

7 videos in, down a random rabbit hole on Youtube, and this is the video i end up with.<br>I&#39;m gonna just stop and watch some Doctor who.......
i love how we got through an entire philosophycal trip before even mentioning Visual Basic, pretty accurate
Perl wasn&#39;t even mentioned... makes me sad :(
gml?
This is the single greatest video I&#39;ve watched this month
No love for logic programming for automated reasoning or integer linear programming?
ok i quit
Me: I want to learn everything.
The real and true brainfuck was from <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pEfrdAtAmqk&amp;t=975">16:15</a>
this video makes me wanna cry
dude
😢
I think therefore I’m scared
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pEfrdAtAmqk&amp;t=885">14:45</a> One of our first year university course had an assignment to program a Styx -game using Assembly. <br><br>The same course had two more programming tasks, an exam and we weren&#39;t even studying to become software engineers, but electrical engineers.
Could have put some hardware descriptive languages (HDL) like SystemVerilog, VHDL and etc for register transfer level (RTL) synthesis to mindf**k your audience even more at the end. LMAO
When I used Scratch for the first time the syntax seemed more difficult than the syntax of Python. 😅😅
i do program in assembly
You forgot the most god tier language of all, MUMPS.
You tried to excise us HumanitiesHeads, wrote language after language, ridiculed us as not important, and where did that lead you? Right back to us.
My first language was C.
What about Verliog and SystemC?
After 30 years a learned several things at about 80 words per minute :-)  Thanks for the tour!
C++ was my first language &gt;,..,&gt;&quot;<br>Everything else seems easy when you learn that one first lmao
You missed the hardware design languages like Verilog
Great video!
A moment of silence for Terry A. Davis.
Lol the first programming language I learned was (forget exact name) but it was an even more basic version of BASIC for PICAXE microcontrollers ☺️
This was a wild and accurate ride; well done sir! Only major omission I could think of was declarative languages like XML, JSON, YAML, TOML, INI etc. I guess you could kinda lump those in with the other &quot;Specialized languages&quot; like HTML/CSS
Me starting programming: &quot;I wish I had started this stuff twenty years ago!&quot;<br><br>Me watching this video: &quot;I&#39;m glad I waited until I was already a psychonaut.&quot;
I’ll forever love and hate fortran. <br><br>When I started college in 2019 I was a physics student, but we had to learn a bit of programming which was done mostly in fortran. I had absolutely no programming knowledge, so it was hellish to learn. However, it made realize my interest (and later passion) for computer science and motivated me to change majors
I just love this video, thx
soy based languages lmao
The first language I learned was TI-Basic for my calculator, and now the programmable calculator I have uses Python
I&#39;ve tried Assembly. That&#39;s the deepest I&#39;ve ever been.
I learned C++ in 2 weeks at the start of my data structures and algorithms class this semester 💀
What about .Net?
Damn good video
Scary. &quot;Always bet on JS, you&#39;ll never lose.&quot;
JavaScript is not a high level language. It is a client side scripting language that adds dynamic qualities to DOM elements.
Yeah<br>It&#39;s really scary when I do this it goes to all languages.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pEfrdAtAmqk&amp;t=150">2:30</a> is this IDE doing bash scripting VSCode?
You know, SpaceTime being programmed in Rust would explain Carcinisation🦀
The last language made it worth it all
I find this video relaxing
Developers, developers, developers, developers!!!
They thought me FORTRAN on the first year of engineering. It was 2010, and I absolutely loved it.
Huge chunks missing... And I do not mean &quot;random languages&quot;, but types of languages!<br><br>- Verilog, VHDL, and so on? They are really down the rabbit hole below or around assembly and define the HW!<br>- FORTH and other stuff where you basically can script the compiler and such trickery.<br>- Languages and programming systems used for mathematical proofing the code you write (there are bunch and for the most sophisticated ones prooving is semi-automatic...
Should have added hardware descriptive languages.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pEfrdAtAmqk&amp;t=550">9:10</a> umm 2025... do you have a time machine or somethin&#39;?
First semester cs stundent here. We’re using c for our normal programming stuff like sorting algorithms. Also we’re learning arithmetic logic and will soon start programming MIPS in assembly
I like your funny words magic man.
How about FORTH and LOGO?
i am about to start programming but when i see the holy c it makes me that i really wanted is to be a priest.
Would Carbon be a good place to start learning a lower level language instead of C++ or would not knowing C++ make it difficult?
Using a terminal and programming with bash are 2 very different things...
Once you learn programming, it&#39;s only a matter of time before you start to wonder what programming language reality is coded in. <br><br>Then the more you ponder that, the more you find out there&#39;s competing programming languages in IRL too!
great vid!!! ..It would be nice another similar video about coding &quot;best practices&quot;!..
god save me!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
This video is &quot;Fine Art&quot;.
My head aches
I wish I&#39;d learn Rust but my work literally doesn&#39;t require me to use it at all four the foreseeable next 3 years so I just can&#39;t justify it to myself
I&#39;ve been working on the Martian Communal Spaceship since 2002, and all we need to function properly is Scratch and Python 2.0
Ragnarok online&#39;s proprietary GRF format. :)
Maybe it&#39;s because my first &quot;real&quot; programming language was RCA 1802 machine language I had to hand assemble, and as such I have code in orbit... But whenever people call C a &quot;low level language&quot; I have to choke back the urge to bash somebody&#39;s face in.<br><br>It&#39;s like when certain f***wits out there say C is &quot;closer to machine language&quot;... what a steaming pile of BS.
How do I program a brain
Html is specialised ? 😂
SQL is strongly typed, you can&#39;t lump them together when you say that tier is all weakly typed.
I see the Perl Camel, along with the other esoteric historical , almost &quot;dead&quot; languages in the graphics , but no mention ! I&#39;m SHOCKED !!!!!! (and crying ... boo hoo ! ) <br>otherwise, you did make me have a good laugh. Cheers ! 😀
This video starts positive, but the deeper you go the more stressed you do feel and the end of the video is just a start of your depression for the next few decades
&quot;A monad is just a monoid in the category of ENDOfunctors&quot;. ENDO is a prefix for functors which map to their own domain (f : X -&gt; X)....
My mind melted faster than the iceberg
My brain hurts after watching this video x_x
I haven’t even fully dug the 1st part.
Awesomeness  :)
Im a C++ Guy personally, and I died laughing with both memes of C++, Thank You. Also (I havent finished watching the video yet, so i apologize in advance if you touch on this) you should look into the &quot;Jai Programming Language&quot; Created by Johnathon Blow (Creator of Games: Braid, and The Witness) Hes developing it as a replacement to C++
The first language that I learned is C++, and this made me cry
During the first year of university, we started with C then in next years we had learnt MIPS(assembly i guess), SQL and Python. But without practice(project) learning process is missing
God-tier ending
All I can say is HOLY SHIT!!!

&#39;For many, the Game of Life was simply a programming challenge: a fun way to use otherwise wasted CPU cycles. For some, however, the Game of Life had more philosophical connotations. It developed a cult following through the 1970s and beyond; current developments have gone so far as to create theoretic emulations of computer systems within the confines of a Game of Life board.&#39;

There are different concerns managed by different languages, and their programming paradigms that each languages aims to provide.<br>With concerns we have system languages which address needs close to the hardware...<br>There are specific oriented languages like SQL ... or Erlang.<br>There are other languages which manage more like business oriented language a problem... Java or C#<br>There are general languages like C, C++ and Java... I consider today Java more an enterprise platform....<br>There are more web oriented languages like Javascript.... and frameworks like AngularJS, etc.<br>And finally is important to remember that software stacks upon itself and generally what we have is a mixture of all above, pile in a specific order....  operative systems, databases, application software.... and there are many side software-tools around the mix with security software, integration platforms, user interfaces, automation software, standalone clients, etc, etc, etc....<br>This is my opinion.<br>I just mentioned because that iceberg image makes quite to think into a kind of climbing mountain, to go through but in reality, you can work with an x group of technologies and only work with that regarding your solutions.
Esoteric languages are garbage...

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pEfrdAtAmqk&amp;t=920">15:20</a> It&#39;s not correct to say that one transistor represents one bit. I think you mean that the state of one transistor can be represented by one bit.<br>In circuits, one bit can be stored in a latch, which contains more than one transistor. Or be stored in transistor + capacitor, but it requires permanent energy supply. And maybe something else, but not in a single transistor.

Back when I was an electrician I partook on the revamp of the baker berry library at Dartmouth campus ( the picture in the video) they use a lutron lighting system up in the very top of the tower above the belfry. It can be programmed to do different things. And each big ass bell has a an actuator with a hammer so someone can sit in a room on a computer, pick a song or melody and the bells will play, it was a coll job.
After Watching The GOAT of Programming (Chris Sawyer : The creator of Rollercoaster Tycoon) who used ASM to code that game Im way more speechless right now
Finally a language worthy of my intellect.<br><br>Good bye spaghetti code, welcome Emojicode.
Im looking to learn Rust, i&#39;m starting with Python. my question is based on this iceberg should i go to something like JS next or something further down lik SQL or Go
Being okay with insulting the God you worship like you did in your thumbnail and actually not thinking it&#39;s an insult and that it&#39;s alright to do so like most of you do is a disaster and one of the reasons why many people don&#39;t respect Christianity anymore.

HTML <b>is</b> <b>not</b> a programming language. Hence the name: &quot;HyperText Markup Language&quot;. And just because CSS has media queries, calculations and conditional selectors it also makes it no programming language.
Yeah no I&#39;ll stay with python
so excited to learn this all over again a lot slower in a few years

You scared the sh*t out of me.
In the early days of the FNF modding scene, everyone wanted to make mods, and just a simple sprite, song and chart swap wasn&#39;t hard, but one mod that basically towered over all was the Whitty mod, &#39;cause it had custom names, 3 songs and the week was added onto the other weeks, instead of being a substitute of one.<br>To make something like that, being that the main game was all in a .exe, I tried to modify the source code, knowing nothing of Hexe, and little of code in general. I actually got pretty far, but I couldn&#39;t modify the sprite offsets and I couldn&#39;t compile the project on my old pc. I guess it wasn&#39;t meant to be. maybe I&#39;ll finish that mod sometime.
Forth, brah.
i paused the video few time to take a breath.
&quot;The next thing i know, i might already be in mark Zuckerberg&#39;s metaverse&quot; had my dying xD
Fortran was not the first high-level programming language, it was SpeedCoding.  Fortran was created based on SpeedCoding
All professors should show this to the class at the beginning of the first year to scare away the unworthy.
i love how our college course starts as off in java on the freshman year, sql on the sophomore, and assembly on the junior year. <br>im in junior year rn and no wonder i hate programming so much.

ooh that ending is good!
HAHAHAHA that was so funny
Just pointing out, as a physicist and developer,  that quantum computers don&#39;t rely on quantum electrodynamics (QED). This theory is a generalization of Quantum Theory, basically including relativistic effects, though this is the theory that best matches reality right now, regular old quantum theory is a good approximation for every relevant phenomena inside a quantum computer. Just like newton physics is a good approximation for bridge building though in reality everything is made up of atoms.<br>Bear in mind this is not nit picking, QED has nothing to do with quantum computers and people will scratch their heads if you bring this up in this context.
Me head hurts
Assembly &gt; R
R 😔
Was this supposed to be funny , <br>Because it fucked my mind so hard that I just don&#39;t know a thing now
More complete than expected, which is good, but also skips things like Perl and the popularization of regular expressions in favor of covering more esoteric historical footnotes.
I am know a Java, C++ and Python (html, sql and other small things:) ). Iam love Java. Why many programmers doesn&#39;t like it?
I&#39;m not a programmer, I came here to see where I should possibly start, stayed to the end and I know now that I should start...to worry...
THIS IS THE SECOND TIME THAT IM WATCHING THIS, AND IM GETTING PTSD EVERY TIME.<br>Thanks Fireship
When I really want to impress, I tell them I&#39;ve programmed in CMOS.   (I did a few Popular Electronics projects back in the day.)
Beginning with a eagerness and brisk to be revolutionary engineer or computer scientist, continued with trolling the whole world with new age coder, ended up thinking about the natural borders of how knowledge could be builded up without the knowledge.

Hmm, I switched from c++ to java as my preferred programming language and always saw it as &quot;c++ with garbage collection (and less pointer hassle)&quot;. If I i want to program dirty I choose Perl as the language to go with, even for cgi scripting for websites (php is for girls). Speaking of websites, yea HTML, CSS and JS ara also things I have to deal with. Basic, Assembler (seems it is called Assembly now, da** Millenials), (Parallel) Fortran, UCSD and Turbo Pascal, Logo and Modula 2, SQL are also dealt with in ye olden days.

The thing about trying to become a programmer is that it is never only about learning to &quot;code&quot;.   Coding within a single language will permit you to function within your own sequestered world, but if you want to play with others, you are required to learn all sorts of peripheral support languages, and design strategies.   I started with Sinclair Basic back in the &#39;80&#39;s just to get my toes wet,  then took the plunge underwater to learn C, which is not that difficult.  I proceeded into Objective C to write iOS apps, and eventually came up against the barrier of the peripheral data exchange languages.   Thats where I lost my motivation.   The program I was building was already out of control due to a lack of proper design knowledge,  requiring me to start over, and learn a whole new set of disciplines.    Programming requires a structured learning path, that is best implemented by the guidance of knowledgable and experienced instructors.   Attempting to learn the necessary tools and design principles on one&#39;s own is a sure invitation for bewilderment and frustration.
No vhdl?
A Monad is &quot;just a monoid in the category of endfunctors&quot; ... Glad you cleared that up for me ! 🤣🤣🤣🤣
lol
fake
&quot;most production code today is not functional&quot; Why did you have to call me out like that 😭
What am i?
I watched this in 2x, and it felt like downloading knowledge.
No, people don&#39;t chose Python because it lacks semi-colons. They choose it because you largely don&#39;t have to import a lib to do large number math, and because there really great user base with really great libs that simplify most things at the right level.
i absolutely fucking despise Prolog<br>i can make logical connections on how to make a program, but when i get to writing it, nearly nothing makes sense
Always bet on JS, you never lose. Wise words indeed..
lulz he say solidity
I want someone to make a language that sort of feels like programming in C# or Kotlin, but is a TOP (type oriented programming) language, that forces you to fully define the range allowed by each type wherever a type is specified as the type used/required. So you can say that a type is &#39;int&lt;1, 3&gt;&#39; (for an int in the range of 1-3), but you can&#39;t just say &#39;int&#39;. The idea is not to conserver memory, but to express all the valid states that can be used and can actually work correctly without crashing the program or making it do something buggy. It would not allow empty arrays or empty strings, instead you would use null for that. When using strings you would have to clarify what lengths are valid and stuff like that.
You can&#39;t forget about VHDL/Verilog
I program using the heat of discrete asceding steps in entropy in the universe. Yuo wouldnt get it
Thanks for the vid... You got me on the knowledge part...
The world&#39;s first programmer is <b>Charles Babbage</b> who wrote the first algorithms for the analytical machine long before Ada.
&quot;So how good are you at coding?&quot;<br>&quot;You don&#39;t exist, you are just a figment of my mind pretending to be sapient&quot;<br>&quot;You&#39;re hired!&quot;
@<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pEfrdAtAmqk&amp;t=289">4:49</a> tbf you did make that two lines longer for java for no reason.
oof the Plato quote at the last min of the video there was bad
What about VHDL and Verilog? should be on par with logic gates ones.
C, the power of assembler with the readability of assembler.  Yes, I have a place in my heart for C because I was used to writing on all hardware.....ALL HARDWARE!
just learn assembly, JS, C++ and you good
And for my engineering men and women out there we have Matlab... where you learn it and promptly forget everything 😂
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pEfrdAtAmqk&amp;t=249">4:09</a><br>Me who learned Java then SQL, then R then Python <br>🤣🤣🤣
You should read Douglas Hofstadter.. , <br>...you followed the train tracks of your logic &amp; now it&#39;s time to twist them into a Mobius strip and turn them back on yourself in a strange loop...
You should do a vid about FiM++
Once in a while I think about the old &quot;html isn&#39;t programming&quot; - it&#39;s 100% true. But Kinda feel like we should be taking about another term like &quot;development languages&quot; rather than strictly programming, cause many devs spend more time on html than programming and it is a form of declarative development.
great video :)
Thanks to our education system that I am in God tier cause they just teach us C language in high school
2022 Nov 16
Man this guy is definitely doin this shit for atleast 15 yrs. He is one of those prodigy developers.
Piet is pronounced PEET
My professor made his class website in Racket. Absolute chad
C master race!
OH god am I really in the Metaverse...?!Strangely this has also made me want to code more...or at least read the documentation for a new language..I think I need help
Still looking for LUA
Assembly got me f**k in college.
For everyone&#39;s information, Lua actually outdoes most languages in the below tier because of its C API.

What about Matlab, wolfram and Verilog :(
Hey stranger, <br>My name is halima..am from somalia ,am a 17 yr girl learning programming, am from a remote village that has problems when accessing technology, I walk everyday for almost 10km in an unsafe area full of militants to go to cyber cafe...its my third month now learning python, anyone kindly help me by buying me a laptop which will help my study,thanks alot...
Very good video
Lol every electronics subject guys feel the pain of learning assembly , machinecode and transistors like me and assembly is quite easy.
Abosulte Chad it is <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pEfrdAtAmqk&amp;t=408">06:48</a> <a href="UCkszU2WH9gy1mb0dV-11UJg/KsIfY6LzFoLM6AKanYDQAg"></a>
Oh wow thank you for the existencial crisis, I&#39;ll continue with Python now
Poor Julia, this programming language was never mentioned.
you forgot lambda calculus but thats alright
Post of these aren&#39;t even programming languages. You&#39;re including query and scripting languages. Difference between programming and scripting languages is in what &quot;format&quot; the code &quot;rests&quot; in on disk (when it&#39;s not actively loaded into a Process). A scripting language resides in the scripting language on disk, and is compiled to byte code for a specific instruction set at run time (called Just-In-Time compilation. But there are gray areas here like anything. C# and Java but use JIT compilation, BUT it a different way than you might think). A programming language will be compiled to the instruction set and reside on disk in an executable format for the specific OS. Benefit to scripting languages is portability across OSs and processor instruction sets. Programing languages don&#39;t require an interpreter though (the interpreter is what compiles the scripting language), so they&#39;re faster. But they also require more work on your part (compilation is just one part. Unless you want to reinvent the wheel, you&#39;re probably want to use external libraries which will require an additional stage after compilation called linking. And it&#39;s the linker that actually creates the executable.<br><br>Query languages are technically scripting languages, but their syntax resides mostly in functions in Set Theory
Impressively complete, Yet somehow managed to completely miss Verilog and VHDL. You know, those languages used to design pretty much all actual modern computers themselves.
ima stick with learning c# but im definitely going to learn rust and c++ after
Gonna put on my resume brainfuck as a programming language
I started learning programming with Python, I thought it was the best language in the world.  Then, at the university, we studied C on the subject of programming, initially it was not easy, I think pointers were the most difficult topic to understand, but after sitting in front of the editor and practicing, I understood how it works.  As a result, my favorite language now is C++.  And I sincerely don&#39;t understand why people think C++ is so complicated... (About pointers, I fell in love with them so much that when I was learning Java I missed them wildly...lol)
This video went a bit too deep in the iceberg :/
Nice video. A bit slow to begin with but I like the ending. As you reach the end, you realize it&#39;s going off the deep end. But it&#39;s too late to stop so you just go with it.
Did you guys see the cameo appearance of Raju Rastogi 😂
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pEfrdAtAmqk&amp;t=304">5:04</a> This &quot;garbage collector&quot; broke me!!
This video reminds me of a song..<br><br>&quot;But in the end, it doesn&#39;t even matter&quot;
You forgot the VHDL and Verilog languages
I expected VHDL and Abel to be put somewhere near logic gates. They are, I believe, called &quot;logical&quot; programming languages. You program things like FPGA&#39;s with it. The thing to remember is that &quot;all your statements are executed at the same time&quot;, and it is helpful to think of your programs as descriptions of logic gates connected together in s certain way.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pEfrdAtAmqk&amp;t=30">0:30</a> I&#39;m already dying 😂
kthxbye <a href="UCkszU2WH9gy1mb0dV-11UJg/8gF1Xp_zK8jk8gSDrI2wCw"></a>
Vhdl where?
I was feeling overwhelmed until the video got to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pEfrdAtAmqk&amp;t=999">16:39</a>😂
I&#39;m very glad I stuck it out to the end. 😂😂😂
its gonna be a really dumb question but : <br> why cant we create a language that does everything ?
Also  Hardware Description Languages like Verilog or VHDL
bro this is fire
the first programming language i need to learn that isn&#39;t scratch or html is to program a robot with java w/ 0 instruction from my coach or mentors. fuck my life.
Thank you, I chose mainframe programming (was forced to actually, and basically bound by a contract) can someone please tell me what other programming languages should I learn alongside the mainframe languages (Cobol, jcl... etc), should I go for Java? python?<br><br>Thanks
Coding 101: Quantum Electrodynamics
in Vietnam, we actually took Pascal as a thing we need to learn in Information Technology subject (where we learn about Word, Excel, etc.) in the old education system which we just renewed this year and only for the first grade of high school which means from the second grade to the last grade of high school,  we have to struggle with Pascal, all for nothing :D
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pEfrdAtAmqk&amp;t=135">2:15</a> well, quite a surprise to see raju rastogi here.
Python needs curly bracket in sets
Piet is pronounced like &quot;Pete&quot;.
You are disrespecting Christ through these images .Change your video.
skipped right over the very real hardware definition languages: VHDL, Verilog. When Apple makes M1 chips, they are using hardware definition languages to design what they send to the world&#39;s 3D Chip Printers (TSMC, Samsung, Global Foundries).  And at the ultimate level; near these hardware definition languages.... everything is made of NAND or NOR gates if you wish.  Memory is feedback loops in circuits.  This isn&#39;t frivilous either; because that&#39;s what&#39;s going on with FPGA programming.
philosophy n math, i think we need to create a new language for the math, why base10?(decimal) or binary, when u try to use other base number mindset daily it will really effect on how u think n view the world (but dont use other base with the intepretation point of view of decimal base, but use the other base in native way), vrymndfck, its like being teleported into other realm
Hilarious ending.  However,<br>INVERT(epist) + STRIP(epist.irony) =   objective reality.
It might be the best road map to start up as this video happened to be posted on the same day i was born, i real beginner here and ready to level up. thanks!
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pEfrdAtAmqk&amp;t=887">14:47</a> ahh yes right here at the bottom is what I have to learn in uni: RISC-V
I think all languages should incorporate the please keyword
Non programmer question:<br>If I had a bitmap with a noise channel and that noise was dithered with an instruction set in piet could I theoretically embed programs within seemingly normal images?
No mention of pascal, not even looking at it.
Epic content :D
Only have one question......<br><br>WHERE IS HARVEY DENT
html  is not a language!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
I think I&#39;m gonna switch to chemical engineering
subtitle making got easier
Never knew Terry made his own code, thought he was just gifted with the sauce
love the ending 😆
Talks about logic circuits and doesn&#39;t mention hardware description languages.<br><br>Me: Noooooooooooo!
Watch this backward for an anti-climatic plot twist!
My head hurts lol
Well time to start learning brain fuck sounds promising
man I just wanna sell my pc
Where was FORTH?<br><br>Disappointed!!
I was just going to finish my programming course but instead I just forged all my certificates and started sending out my CV... thanks!
&quot;Always bet on JS, you&#39;ll never lose.&quot; Yes.
C++ without fear is the scariest book i own.
I have no idea what any of this means but I was entertained throughout the video thank you!
That was great, surprised no mention of Forth, which is surely both unique and has (had 80-90s) a dedicated bordering on religious following
Fuck.... I chose Java as my programming language
Great video!! Love how you ended it!!
Near the end when you got into the deepest part, I started thinking &quot;this guy&#39;s done DMT surely&quot;, then you said that bit about ayahuasca and only confirmed it hahaha 😂
Well this was an unexpected collab with exurb1a...
what an effort you made to create this video even if its worth the dustbin.
is it normal to learn binary at univ and there is that much modern languages
I expected a roadmap of things you should learn in sequence like maths, backend/frontend/scripting languages, SQL, networking, etc. But all I got was like most garbage on youtube, a comparison of different programming languages. Misleading title m8. The video was just all over the place. Yet the title says developer roadmap. You couldve just told us learn SQL for database handling, Java for backend, javascript+bootstrap for frontend, read a book like Design Patterns, SICP, Computer Networking layers, etc.
This is like that meme where the mind just keeps getting more and more electrified and in the end it&#39;s just noise and fuzz and darkness. This was beautiful
Lol
ArnoldC for the win
&quot;Or maybe I just never came out of that Ayahuasca trip ten years ago,&quot; Lol
Holy shit<br>The esoteric languages and everything after that was a blast!
okay, but how are these languages created?
Moral of the story, learn Javascript.<br>Got it
It&#39;s not a road map. It&#39;s a road to hell. It&#39;s not God-tier. It&#39;s satan tier to enslave programmers.  Professors and expeets: this is the holy grail for you: Invent minimhm sets of ptogramming-languages to write source-code solving ANY and ALL programming-problem. Does four colour map theorem ring a bell?
what languages would be recommend for someone doing cyber security.
The shader languages would be feeling really sad right now if they weren&#39;t too busy playing golf
Malbolge is what I used to think programming was like as a kid
Why is carbon made in 2025?
If you&#39;re learning this it&#39;s already too late
In school 15 years ago, we learned programming with Comal, it was the pure horror...
No mention of Latex 😮‍💨
omg the end made me flashback so bad :&#39;-]
How can you write backend code with only js and python?
I can tell you another interesting one my Brother introduced me to: C sound.
as a university student, after learning the basics of C, i have tried to learn OCaml, a functional language. Even with a decent enough level of abstraction most people failed the subject, it was really not beginner friendly and i do not recommend it, especially due to the lack of info there is about the language
&quot;reality only exists in my own mind&quot; Actually, epistemologists have more or less concluded that one can only think, that is, at its base, perceive anything at all at the most primitive level, if both the mind and the external reality exist simultaneously.<br><br>Even if there were a perfect magician, or a brain in a vat, or the perfect deception. All have the precondition of an external hidden reality. For any false form to exist, there must be a reference form from which it was either imitating or distorting. There is no thing in itself that exists without reference, and no reference that exists without a thing in itself. Even the forgeries of dreams, illusions and hallucinations require the architecture of experience, the eye, memory of that which until then was a direct reference.
R is very limited for machine learning therefore any real machine learning projects are written in Python. Kotlin is never going to replace Java, it&#39;s syntax was made to be simpler than Java but Java has since made it&#39;s syntax simpler than Kotlin&#39;s and Kotlin cannot respond. While Java will only improve Kotlin can only get worse. Also, Instagram, discord and many other popular social media sites use Python. This year&#39;s developer survey shows that while Java is more used than Kotlin it is on the decline in terms of use. Meanwhile Python is only behind JavaScript.
I feel like I no nothing after seeing this 😭
The video is ahh quite biGGG hehe :
well that escalated quickly
You should check out Plutus- It&#39;s like an evolved form of Haskell. Also used in Smart Contracts.
That C &quot;only supported procedural programming&quot; is not correct. You can do quite some magic with function pointers, and the basic fact that C++ in its first incarnations was implemented by translating C++ code into C code also directly disproves this. However, it was definitely unwieldy.
First thing I got when I started my apprenticeship for software Dev was a basics course cobol, afterwards you really appritiate java
You can actually &quot;program logic gates&quot; using either verilog or VHDL and synthesise your design onto an FPGA to create your own computer.
Verilog and VHDL ? Yeah it&#39;s not really programming language. But the programming blob is hungry ! We must feed it !
...So did anyone else hop straight in to C++ when they started learning to code?
and the first language im learning in college is C++ (i have completely no idea about programming)<br>wtf am i doing to myself, and wtf they doing to us bruh...
Can&#39;t code effectively but man do I know my logic gates, binary, circuits, and board components.
I expected this video to suck, but unexpectedly, it was one of the best video of its type, if not the best.
I see Viet Nam in here: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pEfrdAtAmqk&amp;t=947">15:47</a>
Now I&#39;m going to start my journey to become a legit programmer!!! Thanks!!!
I was taught LISP and Pascal in uni, fun times.
What about MATLAB?
Java, write once, debug everywhere...Made me laugh.
I was just gonna learn how to code next year, but now I&#39;m intimidated.
The lambda calculus is an example of something between &quot;Behind the Curtain&quot; @<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pEfrdAtAmqk&amp;t=882">14:42</a> and transistors. If you&#39;ve hacked on a language, even a toy one, you&#39;ve probably bumped up against models of computation like state machines, automata theory, regular grammars, and λ-calculus. These are <i>conceptual</i> rather than actual languages; they&#39;re the mathematical bedrock of computation. Compilers draw heavily on this layer for both performance and correctness of higher level languages.<br><br>Think of compilers like a vertical slice of that iceberg that goes down to &quot;Behind the Curtain.&quot; Unless you write machine code, a compiler is making your life a lot easier. The layer of that iceberg supporting compilers is computability theory. Areas of math like abstract algebra start becoming <i>applied</i> math (e.g. lattices). This is where you get programs that write other programs, bridging the conceptual-to-implementable gap! It&#39;s also the level at which programs can formally verify, or prove, other programs. We can add Automath (1967), Coq (1989), and Idris (2007) as examples of that whole family of languages since they&#39;re still active.<br><br>Talk to your local compiler nerd if you find this interesting. You can identify them by the odd grin they make when you ask them about The Dragon Book.
ok so c++
I love that I&#39;m still in college and only truly know like two programming languages, but one of them is C++ because that&#39;s what my college chooses to teach. Had to wait nearly seven minutes for you to mention it. So I got that going for me at least... just don&#39;t ask me about java, js, html, css, actually just don&#39;t ask me about anything other than C++
my brain hurts

As someone who uses MATLAB almost exclusively I feel personally attacked by not even an honourable mention. I would say it sits just above python but below scratch and basic
me that startet with Cpp
you dont have to be on your death bed wondering if you should have learnt to code PHP the answer is a simple NO! HELL NO! NEVER! NEVER EVER EVER!<br>anything worth having coded in PHP already is.. and if its not then its not worth coding in PHP.all you need to know is how to deploy that shit and ideally how  to avoid it entierly to begin with by finding better alternatives to stuff like media wiki etc... i man yes you can get cheap php hosting. but that about the only benefit...
I programmed once withe assambly a compiler to programm machin code. I am an Electronics engineer. And i can only say this is the easyest Language existing. It just does exactly what i tell it to do. Its need a lot of time to write somthing. But you can know evrything from it. You dont move in a room created by others. You know evrything and you know where it belongs. There no problems exist where i think i dont know enought and sends me to searching in the internet.
I used to cling to C, but then Java, Scala and Ruby came about with features like JUnit and I could do TDD. I only pick up C when I want something running faster and can&#39;t really use bit by bit manipulation techniques to do it. There are so many things to play with outside of C like mixins, traits, mixed paradigms or open classes.
people often say the easiest path is the hardest and the hardest path is the easiest so I&#39;m glad this video differentiates itself from videos that just tell you what you need to learn to &quot;get rich quick&quot;

started programming 2 years ago with c++. it was kinda rough at start “Spoiler alert: If you thought it is only hard at start then oh boi. Trust me it gets way worse when u dwell deeper” but it will certainly help you a ton in the long run.
i have been through all the levels of the ice burg 🙂💔

I&#39;m over here hating my damn life that Youtube just turned this one as I&#39;ve been looking up C for STM32F7.<br>UGH
K, final stage is.. basically, you come to a point where you realize that you know nothing :)
C-- is mostly used as an intermediate representation for the Glasgow Haskell Compiler.
I thought you would talk about HDLs. What a missed opportunity.
GOD!!!My broo
This is perfect for procrastination. I should be learning about C# and Unity at the moment, but you all know why I am not.
what is the talking in the background
Speaking truth is ultimate help
started uni 5 weeks ago with c++, thinking about dropping out now.
Hey I&#39;m new to this programing community, everyone here seems quite experienced. I wanna land a high paying job so which of these languages should i start with and where?? Please help
you inspired me to start programing with transistors and binary
Python is beautiful, but I just can&#39;t get warm with dynamic languages somehow.<br><br>Clojure I have a problem with because of inconsistency.

That ended....interestingly...
OK, I&#39;m scared.
Yo is that 2nd to last level real?
This video was lit. Thank you so much for creating this. Educational and entertaining.
Me who has no knowledge about programming whatsoever, not understanding anything said in the video
As an engineer who has been working with software for the past 8 years now, here&#39;s my take on becoming employable for your coding ability:<br><br>1- At this point in time if your goal is to do software there is no reason to go any deeper than C/C++. That&#39;ll have you deal with most low level notions that could ever be relevant to you.<br>Don&#39;t overestimate the quality of coders out there. When I realized the jobs I wanted required coding skills, I spent two weeks binging on tutorials. As soon as I was able to know my way around setting up my programming environment and writing basic programs, I put it on my CV. Got hired within a few weeks and then learned from there. Companies are in such need to hire people that they will gladly hire someone who is inexperienced but who is showing real initiative, enthusiasm and competence in learning.<br><br>2- Instead of trying to learn a gazillion languages, I&#39;d say become really good at one. It&#39;s much better to be capable of doing complex tasks with one language than to be a jack of all trades who can perform super basic operations with a dozen languages.<br><br>Have one main programming language where you can do some complex tasks. Might be C/C++/C#, python, javascript. One of the big popular ones.<br>Then become minimally comfortable with how to use the command line and using batch scripts. This will allow you to tie different tools together and to learn how to control your environment a bit better. It will make you feel like a more &quot;complete&quot; developer.<br><br>3- Learn basic good practices:<br>use git! It&#39;s awful at first, it sucks, you&#39;ll be annoyed with it, but it&#39;s a must. People who code professionally do NOT exchange files by sending each other the latest update via e-mail or some group chat. They use repos so that there is traceability for changes and a commit history that allows you to see what changes were made recently with the ability to revert them if necessary.<br><br>Other good practice, learn to write unit tests. That might seem like a waste of time (it always feels that way) but it&#39;s actually going to save you much more time and inevitable bad surprises.<br><br>4- A caveat to #2, once you start being minimally comfortable with software development, you want to avoid becoming resistant to change and to learning new stuff. When a new project comes along, first see if it can be tackled properly with the tools you know. By properly I mean without the solution feeling like a complete hack. If it cannot, be open to learning a new library, or a new tool, a new method, or, in some cases, if necessary, a new language. But once you&#39;re comfortable with one language, it&#39;ll become increasingly easy to learn at least the basics of a new one. When you do something, before settling on an approach, always spend some time investigating if there exists a ready-made solution for what you&#39;re trying to do and try to do some research on whether there  exists a better architecture or code organization for doing what you need to do. Don&#39;t spend weeks on that, but allow yourself the time to look for a solution that might not have been the one you intuitively thought about. This is what will make you improve over time: you can do an awful lot with convoluted control flow schemes. But there&#39;s more to programming than that.<br><br>So that&#39;s my roadmap for you. To summarize:<br>- Focus on ONE popular language.<br>- Learn how to use the command line and batch scripts.<br>- Learn how to use git and use it systematically.<br>- Make unit tests a habit.<br>- Be open to learning new stuff when necessary (i.e. don`t reinvent the wheel. This isn`t 1972.)<br><br>To echo my final comment on point 4 -&gt; try to learn something new in every project. EVery time, there will be something you felt like you just wrapped it in duct tape because you had a deadline. Keep these bits in mind and in every new project, pick one of the things you felt could probably have done better in the previous project, and this time spend some time researching a better solution. Do this in every project and in 5 years, you&#39;ll start feeling like you&#39;re finally becoming a proper developer.
Im learning how to do C# it&#39;s crazy how programming is a big part in history slowly everything will be programmed from a computer and run by a complex script
1. Get a macbook
Excellent way to end the video by the way. Went to the bottom of the iceberg and then right past it down into the abyss. I think, therefore I am.
One of the first things I learned in programming classes was, essentially, computers are so complicated now that you can&#39;t design a modern computer without using computers. And when it&#39;s done, no one person really knows how the entire thing works in detail. You need many specialists.
I wish I knew enough about programming to understand the gravity that these things seem to have.
Why do i even exist?😭
I&#39;ve been making a great living in BASIC for over 30 years. I use it currently to run the back end for tons of high level web apps. <br>Sure, I know ASM, Pascal, C, Python, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, jQuery, SQL, Java but I prefer modern BASIC dialects.  <br>It&#39;s not the paintbrush, it&#39;s the artist.
I want a coding application that works like blender, but for writing programs. In blender you can write python code and see the result immediately in the 3D viewer. Also you can use nodes for a better visual way of keeping track of all the complexity. Or you can interact with the 3D model directly and it adjusts the code accordingly. However I don’t know if developers are capable of such a complex program. It would also be great if it was capable of voice commands.
Solipsism is a sin.
Holy C 😂😂😂
So basically c++ is better than Java.
PHP, Lua, and Swift are trash
ITS REALLY WORKED LOL THANK YOU DUDE
There is a point on the video that it gets real weird but i couldn&#39;t tell when...
Kabdjsjdj nice
This video is divine, thanks for taking your time on explaining stuff like this... LOL
Go is &quot;simpler&quot; then C?? How is fmt.Println( ) simpler than printf( )?  (notice I didn&#39;t have to capitalize the &#39;P&#39;). How is &quot;func plus( )&quot; simpler than &quot;plus( )&quot;?  And WHYY do modern language designers keep bringing back the totally unnecessary &quot;func&quot; or &quot;function&quot; prefix for functions. Their mere declaration is syntactically enough to infer they are functions. What they hell else would they be? (The concept of &quot;procedures vs. functions&quot; was buried long ago in the dark annals of early programming languages as something a difference nobody every really cared about except the language designer.)

VHDL would fit greatly into the iceberg
I love you Fireship, nothing else to say.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pEfrdAtAmqk&amp;t=288">4:48</a> i personally don&#39;t like type inference in statically typed languages because it almost gets rid of the point of a static type system.<br><br>int x = getsomevalue();<br><br>its perfectly clear what x is in this instance because its specified.<br><br>let x = getsomevalue();<br><br>it&#39;s not so clear, you would need to check the return type of getsomevalue just to know the type x is.<br><br>also a side note: don&#39;t hate on c and act like rust is so superior it hurts my feelings :(
I&#39;ll stop with rust. thx. will go the philosophy route once i graduate (in like 7 months)
This tutorial is amazing and you are really good at teaching !! great job sir !
Why cant everyone just use C , and stop all this confusing mess...
Thanks for fucking my mind !
Can anyone help me in farming here?
Interesting overview. You missed FORTH! ;-)
Learned Assembly in college, its literally just hardly functioning headache
i have a question. Is there a sense to do a low level Ai? does exist that?
Programming in malbolge is like training to create strong passwords manually
Tysm, did everything as described
So basically the absolute bottom is when a comsci phd also gets a phd in electrical engineering. cool
I started studying java as part of one of my first undergraduate CS courses. I have a tiny bit of experience in Python, but I must say... I really like java so far.
I&#39;ll say it: HTML is NOT a programming language. 6502 Machine Code or Bust.
SQL not used to write a complete program?!? spoke like someone who never wrote a complete program based PL/SQL triggers
This was so helpful!! Thank you
Start with scheme
(old fart mode ON) assembly language is not scary or difficult at all. It describes doing things in very small and easy-to-understand steps. Every line is easy to read (unless you accidently swap source and destination in a MOV command, lol), no complicated cr*p like monads.<br>Back in days sitting on my ZX-48k switching from basic to asm was a matter of finally getting asm compiler (:
Works well!! DANKEEE
Thanks! I&#39;ve been searching how to get it and this is brilliant :D
so according to quantum mechanics, it is impossible to simultaneously learn and say learnt. <br>s(l, lt)= s(l)e^-(iElt/h)
Java is pretty much my no 1 favourite language because it has a crap ton of tools and stuff to work with and feels complete with many features. I learned OOP with Java.
It is much more like the history of programming language in 16minutes
Probably the best app from you..
ur a fcking legend dude honestly
C++ is ELITE
This was so helpful!! Thank you
You &quot;build&quot; Lego blocks... like you compose functions.  Which they certainly could be since function is extremely general.
Whoever hacked him is a chainsmoker lol
Wtf man I was just starting to learn to code now I want to die
From 2005-2013 I worked in a big bank as a COBOL programmer. It was not so hard to understand as it was not object oriented. The newest version of COBOL we used was from 1986. Our biggest program was about 13&#39;000 lines of code but it was mostly (and this is how I would describe COBOL) just a lot of MOVE A TO B&#39;s.
Thanks Bruu
holy shit
hey man, you forgot the quintessencial Eiffel programming language! :)
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pEfrdAtAmqk&amp;t=437">7:17</a> адекватный ник
im not sure if i want tto live anymore
Thank you so much bro. Sending virtual hugs. Worked like a charm ;-)
Thanks for the tutorial, it&#39;s much faster than any other method I came across.
A bank in greece uses cobol as core language of their systems... Mother of a friend working there via hr company and she is 60 years old... Doing a very simple thing in java or php, it is days of work in cobol.
Thanks a lot man!
Thank you! &lt;3
how old is guy?<br>knows all the languages
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pEfrdAtAmqk&amp;t=860">14:20</a> did not disappoint.
haskell is the best compromise to be logical with an incredible time saving and clean. <br>Haskell is as fast as C or Rust.
What the fuck? They are
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pEfrdAtAmqk&amp;t=639">10:39</a>
why would you be cancelled for saying html isn&#39;t a programming language? .... IT ISN&#39;T.
I loved the entire video. However the  ending was pure gold! XD
Cool Material:)
people that work on assembly code are saints and simultaneously bat shit insane
im currently learning C right now, it&#39;s definitely really interesting and the concept of pointers is cool
so when i started software engineering at my university , i had absolutely 0 knowledge or understanding of coding. we started with java and i personally found it to be really solid for grasping what programming is and how it works. It&#39;s a good ground where it&#39;s not extremely overly complex, but detailed enough to engage you in the more critical thinking part of software development at a beginner level
It&#39;s kinda scary if i think about the fact that i have used about a 1/3 of those over the course of my life including macroassembler and machinecode and some that are not even on the list because they are used in PLC, like a laddereditor
I started on COBOL yes I’m old. 🤣 Brilliant précis of languages! Thanks.
You missed Common Lisp, the best programming language in the world!<br>It&#39;s still DECADES ahead of almost all other programming languages, and still in active use!
I am learning c++ first...and let&#39;s just say that  without my background as a mathematician I would be completely screwed.
I understood about 55% of this video that’s a pretty bad sign isn’t it
JAVA WAS MADE BY A CANANDIEN
Love how you just go to a whole new level towards the end.
thank you very very very much, you help me a lot
I somehow feel professional and good now, because in my university i learned a lot of those languages. For me it&#39;s irrelevant which language i will use, as i can quickly learn it or have already mastered it. I would really love to program more in Assembler, though. That was very cool! :D
&quot;If that was too easy...&quot; X&#39;D
Mmm yes I will launch my Udemy course about Epistemology with VS Code. 💵💵💵💵
I hope you post a video with all the adobe cracks. As always, you are the best, the crack works great
writing code is great. the iceberg is your brain. there is no right path. ignore everything i&#39;ve said.
gta 5 is written in lua too
that was both informative and hilarious.
Just started working in a big company using cobol, wish me luck Im super deep on the iceberg ahahaha
Ah yes, I love when we devolve into Epistemology. Remember kids all things are merely poor reflections of the immutable world of forms in which place is the only truth.
The ending was dark and deep ...holy cow 😂
it works good
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pEfrdAtAmqk&amp;t=900">15:00</a> minutes in and I freakout cause of the other voices 😅 guess you have some noisy kids or smth 😎
The pronunciation of the first name of Piet Mondriaan is like Pete, not like pi-@. Overall great video, but it is a lot to take 😂. I will watch this video a couple of time from now on to remember it.
merci beaucoup a toi :))
Few points to note : <br><br>- Most modern dynamically typed languages <b>*ARE*</b> type-safe. They simply have a dynamic safety and not a static one. Which means, types are checked against operations at runtime. It is both a good and bad thing, depends on what you are looking for.<br><br>- Typescript doesn&#39;t adds a type system to Javascript, which already has a type system, it only extends it for simpler checking (MUCH simpler checking).<br><br>- In functional languages, &quot;variables&quot; are non existant, as everything is &quot;immutable values&quot; (a variable, by definition, is mutable, because it varies). This is one of the main points of functional languages, since it removes the risk of side effect and context dependency. On the other hand, it adds some patterns such as monads when you absolutely need to model something that is inherently imperative (e.g an actual *state*, memory of the past, as for example a user interface). It doesn&#39;t makes code worse tho, just a bit strange at first, and super elegant once you get the idea behind it :)<br><br>- This video is definitely super fun to watch and quite accurate TBH, I laughed way too hard for the jokes about pointers, and likely will reuse the joke when teaching about pointer !
finally found
I love the descent into esoteric self-exploration. Will now switch my major to philosophy.
I&#39;ve just started to fuck around with HTML and CSS. I think it was a bad idea to watch this video cause now I&#39;m extremely depressed 😂
I think my brain is slowing blowing up with all these languages. It doesn’t help that one language is similar to another language  however uses specific keywords and blocks to make a program.
Every single programmer I&#39;ve worked alongside in my 10 years in the field has either fucked off to management or some form of ops/admin work. lol.
Great video!, you did not mention hardware languages like VHDL.😅
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pEfrdAtAmqk&amp;t=360">6:00</a> and now my brain is on fire
I&#39;m applying as a dishwasher.
c++ is not that harder man don&#39;t scare them but I wouldn&#39;t recommend it
including holy c is fucking based as the youths would say
I&#39;m happy I watched this. Total brainf***k. It&#39;s fun.
I don&#39;t see Objective-C on this list. I was recently forced to use it at work and now I know what hate really feels like.
Surely something is Turing complete or not, it’s not subjective. Saying that, I know nothing of coding.
100 sec videos about those new low level languages like zig, nim, odin would be nice
Great video and very useful. Hope you could monetize it!
Oomygod. I quit
I see video of jesus smoking and shocked, I click
Sorry time to become a Shakespeare and Lolcode specialist
I was looking for a normal crack for a long time and stumbled upon yoWay...
&quot;The only thing I really know is that I know nothing.&quot; Love it.
I can only say I lost myself after transistors hahahah
No one operates as if reality is just in your own mind, save psychopaths and severely mentally ill schizophrenic. If anyone thinks that dead end incoherent illogical argument for knowledge is the end all, they need to think more, read more and dive deeper into logic, it&#39;s a mistake.
I am living in the simulation.
Where does it put me if I started with Assembly and thought it was cool so I switched my uni degree to computer science?

This video has gone viral!
i don&#39;t know how i got here, but this was brilliant.
Thanks for tNice tutorials content. It was the first soft soft video I&#39;ve seen that didn&#39;t assu I knew my way around all of the functions.
I don&#39;t understand anything I just watched
Don&#39;t forget Whitespace, the programming language that entierly consists of tabs and spaces.
This man really went from Basic to George Berkley
thank you so much dude you&#39;re a god
That was great. Thank you.
Anyone cringe when people call SQL sequel
My first year of college, with no requirement for previous programming skills, we learned Java... And Assembly 💀 Java was alright, it&#39;s not too difficult once you get how it works. But Assembly? No. Just no.
I saw you skip that JSFuck logo.
Even if you&#39;re not planning on using haskell (and I&#39;m definitely not), conceptualizing pure functions and using them appropriately is still a requirement to be a great software developer. <br>IMO, of course. Because a statement from a random on the internet like me is always the absolute truth.
Mindblowing.
I absolutely love how this ended.
good
Where the fuck is ABAP :(
This was so helpful!! Thank you
The other geniuses can code I’ll move to farming
U BEST!!!
seeing high schoolers a year behind me learn Scratch killed me inside<br>especially since my first was Java, and it wasnt that hard
Tysm bro, i got a job as an Electrician 💀
Xcode should be bottom of the iceberg while assembly fell off years ago and is currently sitting on the ocean floor.
You mentioned Elixir and Erlang individually but didn&#39;t mention that Elixir runs on the Erlang VM and can run Erlang code fluently.
scratch, python, java, c, prolog, assembly, psychedelic experiences and philosophical question about what knowledge and life actually is.<br><br>thank you, i guess I really understand programming already
first moment I saw the map in the video I started looking for Clojure and Erlang 🤣
Java :( Need i say more?
Man, are you okay?
python - java - html - css
Soooo I should not start with machine code? <br>Oh geez.
For the beginners I would like to recommend &quot;Trying any easy language first&quot;. Just find if you like doing it and think if you want to find yourself doing the same thing in the long run.  I know software developer is a very very popular job nowadays. It also mean the competition is going to be huge. You will need to work harder to earn a place as a software developer. <br>For me , I quitted and change my career after forcing myself to love the web development.
Cries in c++
cool vid
The C++ analogy of blowing your leg off was legendary 😂
Is programming that mainstreamish it has its own meme culture by now?

well, thank you for inspiring me to quit
No FPGA programming mention? sad
From the moment I saw the title, I KNEW that holy C had to be somewhere in this list. I&#39;m glad you didn&#39;t forget about it

HTML is not a programming language!!!
After Assembly and C, I&#39;m woking with Python. Thanks Guido and the community for saving my brain.
Just today I was starting to learn C++. Now, think should directly wait for Carbon. But, what will i do till then😥
hanks lot Sir.. You helping us..
what about wetware programming
worked for me on huawei thank you so much!
worked for me on my motorolla
I know x86 (and some x64) assembly, C, C++, C# and Solidity. Solidity is definitely the most odd language of the bunch, because the EVM (Ethereum Virtual Machine) has a different way of running than physical hardware and it&#39;s difficult to begin understanding how code executes in it and how state works.<br><br>I also know a fair bit of Java and I can read Javascript and Python but don&#39;t like any of them. I loath Haskell and I&#39;m <i>not</i> a fan of functional programming or the elitist attitudes that some people develop when they get out of their minds for functional programming. I work as a software engineer in the <i>game industry</i> and we really value the OOP paradigm for the way it creates structure and order and for the blazing fast performance of languages like C++ and C#. It&#39;s the right tool for the job, and functional programming just isn&#39;t ... if I was working at a science research lab or something then I&#39;d feel differently, but I&#39;m doing what I always wanted to do and engineering game engines and games. OOP has one hell of a second learning curve <i>after</i> you learn the language: learning about software architecture, design patterns, clean code principles (e.g., SOLID, DRY, etc) and it&#39;s not an easy tool to learn to wield. But once you&#39;ve really learned it and gained experience, learned not to write spaghetti code and understand the &quot;philosophy&quot; of OOP, it&#39;s amazing to work with.<br><br>My absolute favorite language is definitely C# ... it&#39;s super elegant, modern and clean, it&#39;s super fast (both in terms of execution speed and development speed), has the absolute best debugging and IDE experiences of <i>any</i> language out there, it&#39;s scalable and maintainable, and it&#39;s extremely powerful. I pretty much always prefer doing things in C# unless there&#39;s compelling reasons <i>not</i> to, which there rarely are ... nowadays, C# runs on every important hardware/OS platform and does everything from game development to web apps. You can even create web apps with no ugly Javascript, which almost makes me want to do a bit of web dev, haha.
The end piece about &quot;reality&quot; made me subscribe. This was some highly informative and excellent content. <br><br>Always wanted to try a deep level langauge and Nim became my option, all thanks to the hard work you put in for the development of this here gem.
I don&#39;t know whether to like this video for it&#39;s information or to dislike it for demotivation 😅😅🥲🥲😂😵‍💫🤒🤯
Dang. Was really hoping to learn how to code the human genome.
This is very useful video..I really enjoyed
you forgot the delphi tier after the &quot;yourself&quot; one
Thank you for sharing this tutorial
My first introduction to coding was through Minecraft redstone back in the day
Imagine pulling up to an interview and you whip out emojicode or chef
After 40 years of programming I wish I jumped on the C bandwagon when it came out. At that time I was on ANSI and Turbo Pascal, and was happy. Today I am on C for anything serious, and happy. <br>  Having C under your belt, makes it a breeze to adapt to any other language that comes up over time, even OO languages ( that do everything the other way around ).
This is great, thank you!
The end is so funny
Misleading.

aw rip so terry was only 2 tiers from true enlightenment
lol when i was a kid in the 90s i first used basic and fell in love with programming. scratch didn&#39;t exist but u need this level 1 language to get ppl interested fo sho
For 40 years I&#39;ve spent most of my time coding on 6502/6809/Z80 assembly language, COBOL, Pascal, Java, C and C++. I&#39;ve recently picked up Scala, Nim, and C#.<br>V and F# interest me, as do Rust and Zig.
I wanted to learn coding, never knew I&#39;m about to venture into Satan&#39;s territory 🤣

cool video but you forgot the manufacturing languages for industrial machines like siemens plc`s to control the machine. i am learning that and it seems easy until you want to do very precise stuff. then you go down a rabbit hole where you indeed want to blow your brains out.
Were going through hell
In the first and second year of computer science we were taught java, haskell, prolog and assembler language. What a fun ride.
F, sharp! 😮
No mention of verilog, vhdl? Close at end but no name drop.
now i am in a good mood
Kotlin was not designed in Czechia, but in Russia. The company is registered in the Czech Republic, but has its largest office in St. Petersburg
What if Istarted with the last one?
You missed the most popular (by a long shot) functional programming language: Excel.
Me and my logic gate for my modular synthesizer is hanging out at the bottom of the berg!
I think therefore I am, and if we can agree that we all think therefore we are, than we can talk, and begin to understand the world around us together. It is because of other consciousness that we know we are real at all.
ice its actually working, im suprised
The ironic thing in all your iceberg is that rather old languages like Common Lisp (1984), Haskell (1991/, Erlang(1986), and in some ways Smalltalk (1972) and Ocaml (1989?), are still the most advanced production-ready programming languages today.
So i am fucking crazy by starting with C++ then? ;^; <br>Because it felt like i was.. (i mean i learned  and understood it quickly, buuuut you know)
I&#39;m now a jack of all trades, but unable to do anything in any of them
I started my career as a nuclear engineer in 2009 working with reactor physics and fuel performance codes written in FORTRAN. I didn&#39;t have an IDE either, just notepad and the compiler. My colleague remembered a time when he had to walk to the computer building with his deck of cards and return the next day for the results - good times!
Cobol it is then.
I&#39;m waiting on the language to end all languages to start learning programming. <br><br>A language as intuitive as how a person speaks their native language. One that uses direct conversational human language. Direct commands like following an instructional manual, or recipe. <br><br>I used to think object oriented programming would be fun because I imagined it would be just like dragging and dropping literal objects like a folder 📂  or file that represents specific instructions and connecting it together. Kinda like building a website with Squarespace or something lol<br><br>Hopefully one day we get there.
i made an ai in brainf**k BWAHAHAHAHAHAAAAAAAAAA
Hi, i work for slack, im a junior software developer and I LOOOOOOOVE java script
I have been thinking, what if all the computer technology suddenly disappears, will I be able to emerge as a hero and build it back from scratch? It turns out I won&#39;t. <br>This is the best video on YouTube.
Perfect ending.

I love watching your videos while coding in my company office, so I can cry and laugh at the same time
🚀🚀 blazingly 🚀🚀 fast 🚀🚀
And yes, the globe is fake.
No mention of C+=. Disappointing.
“And if that is too easy for you” 😂
Best ending I didn’t expect 😂
omg that was awesome tysm really needed that after a shit day...😀😀😀
🇧🇷
Programming is not about learning many languages it&#39;s more of logically thinking 🤔
this video is amazing. Wish they taught this in school.
Javascript syntax is awful.. dude who created it hates humans.
fire video
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pEfrdAtAmqk&amp;t=756">12:36</a><br><br>&quot;Luogo è in inferno detto Malebolge,<br>tutto di pietra di color ferrigno,<br>come la cerchia che dintorno il volge.&quot; <br><br>Now, since it&#39;s written &quot;Malebolge&quot;, where did the i and the a come out of? That said, even if it was actually written &quot;Malebolgia&quot;, the i wouldnt be pronounced, as it&#39;s there just to  change the sound of the otherwise hard g (unless the stress of the word is on that letter, but this is not the case).<br><br>Basically, the Malebolge is a place which includes 10 bolge (this one, instead, makes plural as bolge and singular as bolgia) with as many different kinds of sinners
So o started in the almost bottom of the iceberg, this is the way to make good devs ;)
Rocks were never meant to think, once again humanity has proven its sadistic nature
I always thought Scala was pronounced &quot;scay-la&quot; instead of &quot;scah-la&quot; until this video.
ah would have loved to see the iceberg build back up the bottom with HDL&#39;s for us electrical/computer engineers
TIL that binary numbers were first invented in the late 1600&#39;s
Now I am frustrated 😐
Your video inspired me a lot, thanks man.<br>To Not pursue programming related career that is.

Knowing what knowledge is, is actually pretty easy...<br><br>1) What is illuminated by awareness (you don&#39;t even have to define what a fundamental &quot;thing&quot; looks like, it&#39;s an element of the set representing awareness; the origin of this process, aka why is there a separation of me vs every-thing else will always be uncertain IMO)<br>2) Since knowledge implies a subject to learn said knowledge, this is generalized as a subject vs object relationship.; thus there is a notion of a self to reinforce the subject vs object duality. The simplistic notion of what the self is, is that which is able to distinguish things from itself (whatever definition of itself it may believe/think in reference to; through meditation one can see one is still present in the absence of the mind, I&#39;m trying to not go too deeply into non-duality though)<br><br>Knowledge is that which we recognize to be apart from ourselves. The act of recognition is an activity from that which we deem &quot;the mind&quot; (there&#39;s some sort of acknowledgement, either by physical means through reaching out to grasp it OR a mental projection of some-thing in our mind&#39;s eye). Since we are not the mind on account of being aware of it, that also indicates that any-thing the mind perceives must also be some-thing in the field of awareness (can we be aware of the unaware?). Thus knowledge can be represented as the set of experiences (sustained through memory), more specifically the collection of &quot;things&quot; we perceived to not be of ourselves. You can then further divide this knowledge (set operations of sorts; this part I&#39;m iffy on, exploring fuzzy sets atm to see if knowledge can be mathematically represented as this) into subsets, developing a &quot;more precise&quot; idea of how a field of knowledge can be characterized as. Experientially, this is represented as first hearing about a subject, being curious about it or learning through accident more details about the subject, then gradually developing a more nuanced view on the subject itself (while the notion of what that subject is gradually expands/has more elements over time). Simplified further, knowledge is that which we think we know, the act of knowing is something we ourselves define (aka pattern recognition since pattern recognition implies a subject to recognize said patterns, the mental consequence of classification).

How did we get from programming languages to philosophy?
I&#39;ve been looking for this for a very long time!
Dynamically typed languages were the 2nd greatest mistake in computer history...<br>1st was defining arrays as pointers and not (pointer, length) in C
yaml was clearly made for and with pytoners in mind.
My brain jusy fried by watching this
ITS REALLY WORKED LOL THANK YOU DUDE
Wow, never thought I&#39;d see Hack on a list of programming languages.  Pretty sure that&#39;s only used internally at Meta/FB.<br><br>Also isn&#39;t objective C based on Smalltalk?  In fact, you probably should mention Objective C since it&#39;s still used a lot alongside Swift.  In tech, there has been a lot of bouncing back and forth with switching to swift, then switching back to not using swift, and some still don&#39;t use Swift at all. (Ahem, meta/fb again)

TYYYYYYYYYY
ITS REALLY WORKED LOL THANK YOU DUDE
Thank you, it works perfect!
I dоwnloaded everything is okay
I think I&#39;ll use Holy C and then put my code in a book to be re-discovered in the dark age after WWIII.

Very good video!<br>But first to learn programming, you need to learn this to get along!<br><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2hInivroac">https://youtu.be/W2hInivroac</a>
It worked perfectly!!! Thank you so much
What a good tutorial thanks!!
ITS REALLY WORKED LOL THANK YOU DUDE
u forgoiut x++
Thank you so much you really help me :)
Worked, thx
The funniest thing for me in this video was remembering learning Pascal in school and C -&gt; C++ in university. No simple HTML, python or at least java, we were burrowed in high-level shit and told it was the best way to learn
&quot;... and if I were to say HTML is not a programming language I would be immediately cancelled by the tech community&quot; say what?? HTML isn&#39;t a programming language, it&#39;s a markup language. I would think you&#39;d get cancelled for saying it&#39;s a real language instead. Although with templating languages these days I&#39;d almost consider JS, HTML and CSS as a single package.
basic puns.. nice.
I found sad that you never mencioned Matlab :(
Just started my cs degree, and first language what we are learning is java… never felt so stupid in my life
forgot VBA, the most popular language in all of programming
That is awesome man, thank&#39;s for that, i appreciate this!
I really don&#39;t get the love for C#. The language has way too many entirely redundant features, MS sucks, and .NET is a mess with incredibly poorly organized documentation. Is it just Windows devs with Stockholm syndrome?
Installed, everything works, thanks!
now i am in a good mood
In 2009 I was a freshman at an admittedly sub-tier state university. I thought I was interested in Computer Science, until the first day of an intro class where we had to buy the book the professor wrote, told half of us would fail, and we&#39;d be learning to code in Ada.
Qiskit?
Very nice! I like the ending!! Great video!!
start with the fundamentales, then learn the tools to solve a problem, that defines your language that you&#39;ll use...it&#39;s not about the language, it&#39;s about the issues You need to solve..
I think my uni might have the crazyest of plans, because in firts year you learn Python, then never touch it again, and then they teach you computational methods in Fortran. I did my final thesis last year in Fortran. It is very much still in use xD<br><br>I use python at work know but I miss the matrices so much, they are so much better for math code.
APL is actually &quot;a programing language&quot;???? that is amazing xDD
lol
Kotlin is from Russia not Czechia, JetBrains just have office in Czechia !
All I can say is that that Brainf**k language has me intrigued 🤔   Might have to check that out
As for me, everything is simple and clear. Thank you very much
Are you good my man?
got me at &quot;always bet on JS, you&#39;&#39;ll never lose&quot;
that&#39;s why I hate and love coding, I realized this s..t too late. Now I totally don&#39;t give a fu..k about new languages. This is the result of years chasing the infinity, the languages I learnt, in order:<br><br>C, C++, Matlab,  Java, Basic, Pascal, Visual Basic, C# , JavaSCript, HTML (not a language in my mind, but still), CSS, XML, Python, Ruby on Rails, R...<br><br>Learning all this sh..t and related frameworks libraries fuc..ed up soo much of my time, because this is never ending especially if you need to find a job. Every year a new shi.t pops out.<br><br>So i manged to leave the rat race, I&#39;m working for my self, I still code but I consider coding a tool, nothing so esoteric, because in the end it&#39;s always the same stuff wrapped up over and over again to give you some little incremental functionalities. So these are probably the &quot;tools&quot; I will use until I die:<br><br>**Languages:<br>C++, Java, c#, Js (Typescript), Python, Powershell, Bash   <br><br>**Major Frameworks/libraries<br>Angular, Blazor, Pandas, SCi kit learn, numpy, plotly, Api Frameworks (Django, MS WebApi), Jquery<br><br>**Cloud<br>Azure, Az Function, Az AppSErvice, Devops, Kubernetes (the only cool thing that came out of all this shi.t), servicebus, eventhub, databrick, pyspark<br><br>**Theory<br>Learn, read and practice (yes, read (no videos) and practice) design patterns, just keep your code clean, this is the most important thing.<br><br>That&#39;s it, no more than this is required to rule the coding world.<br><br>I managed to get out of the rat race by investing the first time in Self Storage, not very cool but it made money. <br>I&#39;ve invested in real estate, trade/invest, have some small business.<br><br>Hopefully on the future, there will be a small bunch of languages that will be universally used. I hope for future devs that JS will not be so prominent.
all workеd
Don’t worry everything = 1 😇
gj i love u
GOD!!!My broo
This is the best free software Ive seen. Respect.
I hate how in my uni we started with pascal then moved to C then to assembly, and by the time I got my degree pascal had been replaced with C and C++ was included. So I ended up hating programming due to fucking pascal, which I never really learned to use and barely passed the class.
For once, the software is actually really useful
Mlk, se pá que o canal foi hackeado
To learn Basic is to learn to loose. And in my opinion Scratch seems to be Basic with a new graphics engine. 1.2.3 fight. 😀

you forgot excel vba bro
It works! Thanks a lot.
bruh got me dead at soy-based languages
Even if you don&#39;t use Lisp It&#39;s important programmers learn it, it will probably make you a better programmer
Where’s matlab
You ever see a video and be like, &quot;hey I want to learn that&quot; *clicks on video*? 7.5 minutes in.... I have no clue where I&#39;m at now.
thanks bro
ITS WORKING! nice job dude
Brainf**k just hits different 💀
Fun fact: Holy C actually runs even faster than C is even more versatile, with the caveat being that it only runs on TempleOS, which has no concept of privilege or protection, so *every program runs at ring 0*.
INTERCAL&#39;s &#39;please&#39; keyword actually kind of does something. If you don&#39;t use the keyword often enough, your code refuses to compile because you&#39;re too rude. If you overuse the keyword, the code refuses to compile because you&#39;re trying too hard to please.
I thought about getting into programming. After seeing this, I&#39;m not so sure anymore 🤣
Clojure ❤ Lisp is where I found Zen, nothing else can bring my brain faster to flow state… yet I still have my whole JVM ecosystem if I ever need a specific tool
dont watch this high
go kinda good, C very efficient, typescript javascript cool, rust very cool, python very cool, java overrated very many resources
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pEfrdAtAmqk&amp;t=920">15:20</a> Thank you very much now I know which programming language to learn!~<br>I&#39;ll manually manipulate each transistor in my computer in order to make it do what I want :)
And then there&#39;s me using Wolfram language and TeX because I just want to solve difficult integrals and make pretty documents.

&lt;] respect your work mate. TA Is all well and good but I find it truly baffling that all major crypto youtubers just look at pure TA and completely Ignore the bigger narrative of why BTC is fluctuating and why the future outlook is more encouraging as it seems. It&#39;s kinda Irresponsible to ignore the fact that each ETF launch so far has caused a major dump at the peaks of BTC.. we were already on shaky footing with historically low volume and almost pure whale pumps, narrowly avoiding a long-term bear market. This Is the worst possible time in history to invest as so many don&#39;t back up their crypto assets... more emphasis should be put into day trading as it is less affected by the unpredictable nature of the market. I have made over 7 btc from day trading with Justina Lumen, insights and signals in less than 3 weeks, this is one of the best medium to backup your assets incase it goes bearish. I left Justina contact below take care!...reach her VIA TE LE GRAM &lt;Justinalumen
the mandelbrot reference made me chuckle
Thank you for explaining this thoroughly!
I feel like one missed class of languages are HDL:s, sure computers chips are built from logic gates, but no one designs big digital circuits on a gate or transistor level nowadays. Hardware description languages like Verilog or VDHL are used to simply the process and increase the abstraction level.
amazing video, i was looking at the site and didn&#39;t noticed this get license button 😅
The most enlightened state is when you have all these skills plus soft skills and teamwork skills that makes you a good collaberator in large projects
&quot;If I were to say HTML is not a programming language, I would be cancelled by the tech community&quot;<br>My man, we definitely do not live in the same corner of the community then. I would be cancelled for saying the opposite.
Hahaha
good work king, love you
appreciate the outlook
U BEST!!!
i love esoteric programming languages
I&#39;d stop @ assembly, that&#39;s how deep any sensible human could go.<br><br>Like who is gonna type 100101010011110101001100011010111
so you skipped D :/
Very insightful, I love it. Thanks 🤘
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pEfrdAtAmqk&amp;t=641">10:41</a> I see what you did there 😅
My favorite part of this video is,  it only remained to the language explanation and couldn&#39;t even start talking about actual SWDevelopement stuff ;)
Seriously, if you’re working solo and want to write a java application you are way better off writing kotlin and targeting the jvm
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pEfrdAtAmqk&amp;t=829">13:49</a> I think emoji code is actually a cool idea. Emojis can convey their meaning faster than text, so if we could translate code into an emoji representation, it could improve productivity and readability/orientation.
the dark end thou
After learning all these codes, you are saying that external environments all are fake...
im at the +<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pEfrdAtAmqk&amp;t=36">00:36</a> second mark and can tell you now: everything is just an abstraction of pointers that you will wrangle with c. And if you need more, now you&#39;re just messing with assembly instructions, fin.
The real shit starts at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pEfrdAtAmqk&amp;t=965">16:05</a>
Java is an absolute dumpster fire regardless of skill level.  Period.  It lacks the ability to do templated inheritance and every single operation throws exceptions, which, if uncaught, will crash the application.  The only thing you can do to keep your Java applications from crashing is to wrap the entire app in a giant try-catch and ignore every single exception.  I gave up years ago trying to fix all of the crash bugs in my Android apps written in Java, wrapped them up in try-catch to ignore every single exception, and called it a day.  Everything&#39;s been free of crash bugs ever since.
I dоwnloaded everything is okay
I feel like walking into a cave in the middle of nowhere and calling it a day. I can grow a beard and whittle something. Thank you.
Psychedelics have never tried to mimic sobriety at me. Is that unusual?

c is literally arceus
if this guy&#39;s video is up to 16 minutes...hehehe, information overflow 🤣🤣🤣<br>well this is more like a lost of languages....but not languages one must do by all means...
Theres so many of them that only use walls.. they think if they still get the kill themselves its not really cheating, their just giving themselves the edge is all..
i personally am i chad and i know assembly 86 c# and python like a man of culture
DWORD!
I used to code the wildest things with actionscript, now I have to centre divs. FML :) Farm for me too LOL
You seem to forget VHDL, Verilog and ASIC.
I&#39;m not trying to flex, just to add a little clarity for those really interested. I do RE so I work in ASM 5 days a week. <br><br>Below ASM is not straight to binary. You could learn the OPCODES generated by ASM instructions/mnemonics. Instructions add a layer of abstraction to the differences in the minutia of src and dst type (reg, mem, imm) and size of the operands. One ASM instruction might have a dozen opcode variants. This is actually quite useful for some things; most obviously modifying/hacking binaries or constructing &#39;shellcode&#39;. Also, learning binary is quite useless, so lets skip to something useful at the next level.<br><br>Bare-metal programming is another step below doing assembly on top of an OS. Bare metal is writting the entire program in assembly to interface the hardware directly. THis is done easily with microcontrollers.<br><br> TTL,Transitor-Transistor Logic, is (in my opinion) using ICs that are mostly Logic-based (OR, NAND, XOR, etc) to create programs. Using 74LSXXX chips are a great way to pull a layer of abstraction away from a uCPU&#39;s mariyid logic gates. There are many projects where people build entire computers using TTL 74LSXXX chips to created the ALU, Instruction Decoder/Encoder, etc.<br><br>There are several other layers i think that would come before microchip fabrication and quantum mathmatics.
Me in the end : whatta f*ck, you going too deep
I dоwnloaded everything is okay
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pEfrdAtAmqk&amp;t=960">16:00</a> is when the shrooms kicked in
All these languages and they made us learn ADA in school...
You skipped Perl?  The duct tape that held the internet together ca 2000?
Well, I will just develop my project in C#. Because it&#39;s the best language and I know it most.
&quot;PLEASE&quot; in INTERCAL actually does have a use. If you don&#39;t use please often enough, the compiler will not execute, producing an error regarding politeness. It&#39;s not a valuable use, but it is required for the language to operate.
that escalated quickly, lol
LMAO how are the meme languages even mentioned? These are not codes at all, it’s just garbage
When he got to c++<br>me: LET&#39;S FUCKING GOOOOO LADS!
;Pretty comprehensive but you skipped two languages which has logos in them: &quot;Modern Language that you haven&#39;t heard of&quot; and &quot;Historically Important Language&quot;.  Raku (aka Perl 6) and Perl 4/5.<br><br>There are two that you might want to include: Verilog and VHDL.  FPGA are now becoming hotter for a lot of reasons.<br><br>At the bottom, it is just Turning complete and Computer Science is just applied maths.
Amazingly you have forgotten the programming language RPG by IBM. It was created in 1959. It is still in use today at companies still having mainframes in production.
I think I am already at the last stage. Or maybe I should stop watching Anime.
Well my wicked professor started 🙄 😒 us with C instead of python or Javascript  for beginners like I&#39;ve never coded in my life and he started us with C like when i come to class I&#39;m always confused i watch youtube videos but bro i just feel stupid  i remember before i started uni i was learning python and i thought wow programming is easy until i saw C and i wanna just live on a farm😭😭😭😭😭
🤣 I watched this on double speed and my brain melted... or maybe it was the iowaska 😂😂
HTML + CSS is turing complete? oh my god..
Before you reached transistor level you had to mention VHDL and Verilog.
BROOO thankyou so much, this really helped and the tutorial was really easy to use as well :)
My programming journey was: Basic (C64 in the early 80s) -&gt; Pascal (PC) -&gt; Assembly (M68000) -&gt; C (PC) -&gt; C++ (PC) -&gt; Simula (at Uni) -&gt; Assembly (x86)....after that...I have not really programmed much for the past 30 years.

Why not mention Minecraft Redstone?
i see racket there :)
GOING TO SEE IF MY CODES WORK ;<br>800 LINES OF CODE , 900 ERRORS 🥲
thank you for the detailed guide, it helped me install this soft
So you&#39;re telling me that as an electronics engineering student I am learning(in a &quot;fundamentals&quot; class) about logic gates, and the only thing harder than that is quantum electrodynamics. Awesome. No wonder why i hate my life. I came here to see if I want to switch to software development and this definitely helps. But then I&#39;m sure I&#39;ll want to die then too just with less ones and zeros and things that look like dicks.
GENIUS
I learned programming in C…I don’t recommend it today!<br><br>I also learned VHDL…don’t recommend that either 😊
I started with Java...love Java.
Gads,... so happy I&#39;m not a beginner. Truth is, learn 2, C based modern languages and you can learn them all with little effort.
Well, I tried what I read the other day and it was mind blowing to see her writhing with pleasure and ready for anything. It all started when I learned to last at least 30 minutes go’ogling the latest by Greyzar Drinbo and now she just can&#39;t have enough
I see the Perl camel in there, silently holding up the rest of the iceberg without recognition. Just like Perl in the real world.
As a C++ Developer, I can confirm that I have shot myself a total 0f 3 times in the past 5 years.

btw, HTML isn&#39;t a programming language. :p
When I was 12 my parents gave me a 600 page textbook on a programming language that isn&#39;t on this list. Perl. I gave up at regular expressions, chapter 3.
Pretty nice,thank you soooo much
I just started learning and saw this now I&#39;m extremely stressed and questioning my existence good video though.
Holy fuck you just decribed exactly the struggle I went through when learning Haskell, on the dot

Wtf do u mean &quot;binary (1679)&quot;
Pascal !!
I&#39;m a Senior Principal Software Engineer, programming for 25 years and a fan of many different languages.  This is the most accurate overview of languages I&#39;ve seen without going overboard.<br><br>There are some notable exceptions like Perl (and pseudo-languages like Regular Expressions) but it also had a few I wasn&#39;t aware of, like V and C--.<br><br>Well done.
This is the best free software Ive seen. Respect.
I stopped after 5 minutes. That&#39;s the most I&#39;m ever going to do. And even that&#39;s a lot 😂
And lets not forget COW or whitespace
This video is the hallmark of how the &quot;web generations&quot; brain work... the information is rushed, cobbled up, superficial... but what counts is always having images, cartoon, and colors continuously flashing on the screen....
Woah, great video mate!
The thing about C# is that it started as an O-O language but is quickly evolving into a functional language. It&#39;s a thing of beauty.
directx error
I think i will stay with python
learnt javascript, I consider myself fit for quantum electrodynamics.  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23don">#DON</a>&#39;TWAKEMEUP
i learned c++ and c# without any of the other coding knowledge
And then each of these programming languages have from hundreds to thousands of frameworks to abstracts your code from the complexities of different APIs, standard algorithms, operating systems, and platform features. And then, there are build systems…
ahhh out of all the videos this worked thanku
Really work
I paused the video right after the end of Historically important language because I don&#39;t want to see any more bizzare things.
This is the best free software Ive seen. Respect.
There is a thing called objective-c++ which I&#39;ve had to recently touch to create a game engine module in C++ for iOS. Objective-C++ is, uh, it just is.
At <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pEfrdAtAmqk&amp;t=73">1:13</a>, when the speaker says &quot;you might be surprised what you can build with it,&quot; was the Scratch game that appeared supposed to show off how impressive Scratch projects can get? Because... that game literally looked and sounded like a fake game they animate for a sitcom or advertisement. Scratch&#39;s website has a dedicated Featured selection, I could find a sample of something more amazing in 30 seconds.
As always, everything is super. Waiting for new soft from your team
Is there a jpg or png for this?

Nahnahnah! The legend rifle is just the bullet. You pick it up, throw it like a dart, pop an eye and turn the course of an entire battle.
Fun and informative!
Just simply put the code, it works! thanks!
thx for soft mate
Yeah C is easy to learn until you&#39;re trying to pass an array to a function and you have to pass a pointer to a pointer that you have to alter the value of to traverse the array. I get what you mean though, its relatively easy as far as low level programming goes.
No mention of Eiffel?
the inaccuracies in this list....lol
What the heck is this video about? I watched half of length of it. I had no clue what this guy is talking about.

A full stack developer is typically described as knowing a language that produces interfaces (ie HTML, CSS, etc) as well as business logic (ie javascript, python, etc). Some include understanding of cloud languages/frameworks (ie SQL, NodeJS, etc).<br><br>We then have server and OS developers that know lower level languages (ie C, C++, ASM, etc)<br><br>full stack developer + server = whole stack developer<br>whole stack developer + hardware manufacturing = entire stack developer<br><br>I just need to learn to build my own motherboard and I will be an “entire stack engineer” 😁
You’ve inspired me to finally quit programming and take up farming. Thank you
So as a Julia lover... It allows you to be either static or dynamic typed. Proper Julia code declares types for everything and if a type is declared the compiler enforces it strictly. It&#39;s the big advantage Julia has over Python/R

Wow
Me who thinks mathematics was way better after watching this video
It worked. Thanks a lot
Fantastic video. My basic layman self thought C sharp and C++ were the same thing for years oops.
Its working man!!
Knowledge is the ability to use something that you think you know towards the goal of spreading love or more knowledge.
That went down hill pretty fast.
Worked, thx
The video is good but i feel like you didn&#39;t go deep enough.
jajajajajaajajja im a PLC programer so basicaly i jus use lader logic quite similar to logic gates  its not to hard
Well earned sub!
Thanks for inspiring mein 🔥 Ship now I will learn all of these.
I read &quot;gift of totalitarianism&quot;...
merci beaucoup
Darn — just wasted 13 minutes — why make this video ?
thanks for the help it help my every thing i need to install
I really think assembly language should be above lolcatz or whatever it&#39;s called
As always, everything is super. Waiting for new cheats from your side
Thanks! I&#39;ve been searching how to get it and this is brilliant :D
Piet is pronounced more like Pete (1 syllable)
You don&#39;t learn &quot;a language&quot;. That&#39;s such a &quot;your uncle on Christmas dinner&quot; approach to programming.<br><br>You learn software development. I learned Java, C, C++, C# and PHP in University. Does that mean I can&#39;t program in Python? Lol of course I can. It&#39;s structured but admits objects, and has weak typing (kind of like PHP, with many things from the other languages). I can&#39;t really do functional programming, and I&#39;m not very strong on declarative programming, of course, for that I&#39;d need an extra. <br><br>But for 90% of the jobs out there, when it&#39;s not the languages I&#39;m an expert on, I&#39;m just 1 month of work away from being a senior programmer on them as well.
All the best,
What a great video

Man how you research that beginner as  very fit with all of your voice pronunciation and video tutorial so hot....
True
Thanks dude...It helps alot especially on beginners like
My father codes in Cobol along with his team to this day.  According to him, they don&#39;t get many people applying that know the language which has sort of made him and the people of his team indispensable to the company.  These are old dudes in their late 60s and 70s with no one to replace them.
Chemists of Space Station 13 need to learn brainfuck to get godlike. Not a fun ride.

Via the Curry-Howard correspondence, mathematicians have been programming for millennia, even if they were mostly not aware of it. Mathematics is the deepest and oldest level.

Programming is saturated. Way easier less stressful positions that pay better
I&#39;m missing VHDL and suchlike in this overview. nice to see my childhood nightmares slide into oblivion...
in the end they are all the same, thy follow a specific syntax. what&#39;s left is the use case and your problem solving skills.
Thanks bro that was really helpful
Great video, the program works great
Just came here to say how Haskell marked my life in just 3 months of University course. <br>I don´t know if i will hate something more than this
Bro i started with C lol
Duuuude took that hit!
THANKS ALOT MA MAN IT WORKED FOR ME SURE T
I’ve never understood the logic behind people sharing “the best programming language right now”. People are forgetting that learning language is just that, learning a language. What one needs to learn is the basics of computer programming. Its not how you write, rather what your write.
The real question is what language is the simulation we are in is written in, hope it&#39;s not Java.
The end is epic
Stupid snobbish bullshit.
Left out PERL, God Tier scripting

Where are Coq and Iris? Pathetic.
i love that he talks like hes serious but hes not
so i will learn assembler now
I learned BASIC first but Pascal after that. No mention of the legendary Pascal? After that I picked up a real language C++ and mixed assembler because you couldn&#39;t do graphics in C++ without ASM code at that time.
PHP is still used quite a bit at Facebook. To say they used to use it or whatnot, is not the truth. I know enough engineers at Facebook to definitively say, it&#39;s still a lot of goddamn PHP. Which isn&#39;t bad, as PHP is pretty good now. After Facebook did the HipHop program to optimize it, that was built in to V7 of PHP and now it&#39;s pretty damn efficient.
perl, J, and matlab
The last 34 seconds are truly golden.
Understand.
This video was fun and informative. And thanks for not trying to discredit our homie Terry. Too many people shit on him.
BLAZINGLY FAST
It really worked for me after I look and try some tutorials, yours is the one that worked. Owe you a lot.
God damn - no! No fucking rust, go, zog, cog, log e t.c. Only pure &quot;C&quot;!!! If you fuckin noob don&#39;t fuckin write programs... And if you noob, you will shoot your leg anyway...
I could link so many memes relevant to me watching the final 5 minutes of this video..

I can confirm that IntelliJ makes Java write itself
C is my all-time favorite language.  It let you do whatever you want.  Want to write to an OS reserved address?  Go right ahead.  Oh did it completely destroy your machine?  To bad.  Next time don&#39;t be a dip shit.<br><br>You learned so much about how everything worked.
At my college C++ was the veru first programming language that we learn. It made so many people change majors
You forgot the mother and father of all languages: MATHEMATICS !!!!! You can use it anywhere in the Universe...
Sorry, but where is the country of MIT? USA, Scotland, France I know, but I cannot find that one on the map.
Wow. I&#39;ve done programming courses but there&#39;s a lot of stuff that went over my head like no other video I&#39;ve ever watched.
I think I&#39;ve just learned The Deep Learning really deeeeply
Came to know more programing languages and left with an existencial crisis at the end, 10/10!
As an electronics engineer, I started at the lowest end. And now, I’m stuck there as well.
I remember a language like BrainF**k called Fartstis or Fartstik? It was equally as nonsensical LOL<br>Great video!
I remember using ALGOL, FORTRAN, Pascal, and COBOL in the 80s.
So informative, thanks a lot!
Scratch is tough enough as it is
nice
Holy C is the most based programming language
That was great. Thank you.
No Perl. I wasted 20 years of my life apparently. I still love it though.
Keep trying
Awesome program
Just stopppppppppp. Please stop talking, it&#39;s my first week of programming😭
c c++ and rust are low level system languages. that alone earned my dislike
I thought I was going to hate this but after watching it to the end I&#39;m only indifferent.  Congratulations.  I have to comment though your Cobol advise was excellent.  That&#39;s definitely what you want to pursue if your ambition is to have the most exciting career possible in retail banking.  And if you are truly gifted don&#39;t be surprised if you are eventually uplifted to RPG IV, widely considered to be the Quenya of banking IT&#39;s Valar.
Que viagem
Wait.
I&#39;ve been programming proffessionally in Silicon Valley for the last 5 years, &amp; I can say this checks out. Most everything I do has been in Python and Javascript (+HTML/CSS), and sometimes Java. After running into the limitations of OOP/dynamic types, I started exploring functional languages &amp; approaches and other statically typed languages. One note is that my undergraduate studies actually had us explore this iceberg in a u-shape: top, lower, then back to top again.
As a non-programer, C++ is by far the most talked about and used in schools around me. Didn&#39;t even know the name of any other ones here.
Always Bet on JS, You&#39;ll Never Lose insert at the end : P

I love how carbon was invented in 2025 according to this video (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pEfrdAtAmqk&amp;t=551">9:11</a>) <br>guess if i learn it i&#39;ll know the future ;)
That final bit hit hard
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pEfrdAtAmqk&amp;t=134">2:14</a> the picture is from a movie called 3 idiots. It&#39;s a really popular Indian movie and I found it hilarious that you added that because that was unexpected lmfaoo
I just want to make good money making websites
Keep trying
Nice list, but I missed microcode (the programming language used for telling the CPU how to execute the machine code)
Forth, postscript, clone, ladder... So many more. I learnt about a few more here, thanks.
can really relate to the trip thing man
May I please post another comment? I am amused at how you ended your descent with the philosophical question of knowledge and epistemology. Ha ha ha ha! You don&#39;t have to go that deep, dude. You are making this more difficult than is needed. Instead, you might have mentioned the <b>analog</b> computer.
Also, I had an absolute blast learning assembly language. In fact, if assembly language does not interest you, then you are not a true programmer!
SQL is not a true programming language. You can&#39;t even produce a &quot;Hello World&quot; program, for instance (actually, I guess that you sort of could). You could not do a mandelbrot set, though. It should be thought of an interface to databases.
I know how to program in assembler, design digital circuits with gates and a little bit of C, but I can&#39;t understand the rest
ABAP. Where is ABAP.<br><br>You should have included a psychosis warning. Almost not audible children sounds in the background are no joke to a morbus studiosus! :D
Tcl?
What about the programming language used in the human brain?
I kind of like the fact that Mupms didn&#39;t make it into the video, hence it is not a programming language.
Everything works perfectly
Wow. This was so comprehensive. And the end was unexpected. Good job man.

I&#39;m weird in the sense I kinda went all over the place. I started in C#, got really used to that then got really into PowerPC/x86 assembly then tried web development and I&#39;ve been in a programming crisis ever since. C#/Assembly just makes sense to me for some reason but when I tried to make something in react or make a website period I just wanna throw my keyboard. I do not like web development lol

I was wondering how far down all the electrical engineer shenanigans would be on this list. Assembly isn’t that hard unless you don’t have the hundreds of pages documentation of what your working with.

I started my programming journey with c++,  <br>tear start flowing when I discovered python<br>and God damn I hate js
I&#39;m still mad that in my programming class we learned C, C++ and pseudo-ASM instead of something actually useful to Network engineering.

Interesting... I thought C was designed by Dennis Ritchie. That stuck with me because the first C compiler I got was some K&amp;R C clone (or so I was told)... so at best Brian Kernighan (the K in K&amp;R) and Richie made C. Not even Wikipedia mentions Ken Thompson for C. But Thompson made B and Unix which is not less an accomplishment.
I&#39;ve programmed in HTML, Java and Python. I had to learn HTML and Java for classes (in college and high school respectively), but Python I have only learned as a hobby. I also used a markup language called Harlowe, which is only used in a obscure software called Twine that is made for making branching interactive stories that are playable in a web browser, but I&#39;ve always ended up calling HTML when using Harlowe so what I wrote in Twine was kind of a hybrid between the two. This is an interesting watch, it&#39;s interesting to see how programming languages develop.
who else went to see mandelbrot set in scratch
I see there&#39;s no love for Live Code
Good work
At the very bottom you have thinkscript
I learnt assembly, so it&#39;s mean, I learnt from the top to the bottom of the iceberg?
You&#39;re me aren&#39;t you? I&#39;m getting surer and surer that this is all in my/our head!
Alright, so we&#39;ve went from Scratch to discovering the ultimate question of whether we really exist and if our minds can be broken down into nothing but ones and zeros... makes sense.
thanks man . you helped me so much thank you again

Funny that I mostly code on C++ for many years, code a lot on C#, code sometimes on C, Python, Bash, used to code on Delphi and Pascal, Basic, had to write on HTML and  other tag-languages. And I studied for micro/nano electronics engineer in university thus I know a lot about transistors, logical gates, their manufacturing and physics behind them.

Have been up and down almost every level (except the very tippy top). Most of these languages have been at least OK, some have been pretty great experiences. But Lisp... let&#39;s just say Lisp and I aren&#39;t on speaking terms.
And what are the options to program genomes with crispr? When you put &quot;you&quot; a the end I was sure you will talk about one or more of this new langages that compile to &#39;crispr commands&#39;. i don&#39;t know how to even name it.
....what....the....FUCK
I&#39;d say that the esoteric languages rank lower than things like assembly or machine code. In that, you never actually encounter them, they exist purely as a joke between programmers and/or to test your skill in learning new languages and concepts.<br><br>machine code and assembly actually have a functional use - you can get paid to know low level languages. you cannot get paid to know brainfuck (or my preferred version, fuckfuck)<br><br>I also like whitespace as a esoteric language. completely fucking unusable. its great. Also you can encode whitespace into other code, and then depending on the interpreter you use run the whitespace code or the real program. is fun
With regards to the intro<br><br>The actual #1 programming language right now to learn is Cobol. what you do in Cobol doesn&#39;t translate well to other programming languages, but also other language concepts don&#39;t translate well to Cobol, this makes it difficult to use and also, its incredibly outdated, having been invented in 1959. It is niche but many companies still run on systems that can&#39;t be upgraded by people who do not understand Cobol.<br><br>Cobol has no future, the only current use of knowing cobol is upgrading systems away from cobol.<br><br>there, enjoy your riches.<br>i hate cobol.<br><br>Edit: Finished the video, saw what he said about Cobol. Yes.
I feel like batch is both at the tip of the iceberg and at the deepest, darkest point.

every device should be a selc contained PC ... that way it can deduce drops in packetsz
computers should have 3 internal clocks and 3 external onesz ... by sight sinc the internal then you get omni timing across time space .. PC computing diversity is based on timing not just data setsz ...
the CPU should have &quot;ASSISTANST&quot;  assisntatnt co procreesor chips to the central director nacigator CPU
wach compoent should have its own Chip to offload its process after the CPU has determined it in its grand scehema
Vector desktop graphicsz .. Grid the O/S  .. stroage is in grid x1,y1,z1  processor A isz in grid zzz etc each memory chip should have a mini CPU to interface it and offload .. SMART RAM!

Man, things are so different these days, although you have certainly hit upon a few of the key points I&#39;ve watched over the years.  I discovered BASIC in a geometry textbook appendix when I was in tenth grade. I whined until I got a VIC-20 and learned BASIC and 6502 ML. That was more than enough for my first programming job in the &#39;80s.<br><br>But the next step was going to have to be either Pascal or C, both of which were supported by those amazing new IDEs Borland introduced. I physically went to a physical bookstore and purchased Turbo C. I made a living in the corporate world with C for about eight years, adding SQL and shell scripting along the way.<br><br>Then came Visual Basic for a few years I&#39;d rather not think too hard about, then Java. That one lasted me a very long time. It was introduced to me by an IBM consultant who was excited about their new &quot;Visual Age&quot; IDE. Youngsters will know it as Eclipse. I knew it as a properly object oriented language with a never ending series of new libraries and techniques.  EJB 1.0 anyone? None for me, thanks, my brain is full. I admit it: It took me too long to absorb functional programming because it became so easy to do so much with OOP, and I had to support pre-8 Java versions for a long time anyway.<br><br>These days I use JavaScript a lot, which is probably why I&#39;m awake right now typing comments on Youtube at 4 AM. I work with a team that really only knows JS frameworks, so I adapt. But man, the lack of native type safety feels so weird.<br><br>The next big thing for programmers should probably be Rust. I&#39;m learning it myself because if my portfolio collapses I&#39;ll be working for a few more decades. Besides, for a real developer, the learning is the real reward.
I got to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pEfrdAtAmqk&amp;t=540">9:00</a> and hugged my Eloquent Javascript book so tight that I broke the binding

A very nice and informative video.<br><br>As for ADA, if I may, it&#39;s main selling point is that it&#39;s safe.<br>As in, when coded, you can prove that your program won&#39;t crash.<br>Well, it may not do what you wanted it to do, but that would be because YOU the programmer, made a mistake, not the compiler.<br>Also, it came with network and multitasking out of the box, that&#39;s really sweet.<br>The only problem I can see is that it&#39;s really, really verbose for the declarative part.<br>You can&#39;t just programm &quot;on the fly&quot; and see what will stick.<br>You need to declare everything and anything.<br><br>So, ADA?<br>Hell yes! but for big, security focused programs.

MY GMS DOES NOT soft LIKE YOURS
eww.. not basic.  Qbasic.  Qbasic is for beginners.  Basic is just a bad language all around.<br>JS and PY are not a step 2 language...  JS is basically web C... PY is basically bloat-trash.<br>HTML and CS should be before JS... you won&#39;t even be using JS programmatically until you know HTML...<br>C# is just user friendly C++... extra garbage collection and error handling built in...<br>Which to your point about garbage collection for GO, no.  You still have to worry about memory management.  Not doing so is why you encounter so many programs that have memory leaks.  Always.  This is the case always.<br>I wouldn&#39;t call C, C++ low level... when I learned them they were not considered such.  Low level is asm like MASM and TASM.  <br>No one really writes in machine code, machine code is what MASM and TASM create.<br>You then use that machine code to compile an EXE or COM file...<br>And this is an illusion, but centering it around yourself because you are bound to your own knowledge is a flawed approach and lacks awareness.<br>Programming since 1995... when I was 12.

I knew you will miss TeX, LaTeX and expl3. Not to mention LaTeX3. <br><br>You didn&#39;t disappoint. Maybe you did.
Is Matlab not considered a programming language?
Thank you for sharing this tutorial
First learn the basics with keyboard and mouse. Then get a soft board and content interface if needed.
and i wish you good luck with your future endeavors ❤
When I made tNice tutorials, there was no working Mac version. On mac, a right click is a 2 finger press on the track pad.
Thank you in advance
Bro I’m learning racket at the university of Waterloo and it’s brutal
this is why I skip everything and code in assembly
C++ (I&#39;m not sure about C) does have &quot;references&quot; like Rust does. You can get away with using these instead of pointers, but you still have the option of using pointers.
works, chock-full thanks!
cool tutorial, 100% works, +rep
There should have been a final level for COW programming language
Absolute Zero
seems like brainf**k could be used for genetic programming using bitwise operators.
I woke up, and here again a new video from view bot king! Great mood for the whole day!
Really good, and thought provoking, as an old timer computer scientist.  Thank you!
Try to see soft design , composing and setuping as three seperate tNice tutorialngs to focus on and it might will make more sense
working bro! Thanks a lot, +sub +like &lt;3
No love for D Programming Language :(
So far Iat least have written programs with Python, Java, C, Prolog and Assembler. Seems like I picked something from everywhere in the iceberg lol.
Like it extremely much
Haha😂
thank you embodying forming it opensource
the ending got deep
when you’re in the channel rack, click on gms to open up the gms nu, in the light blue screen on the top left look where it says
it sounds more like rantin than informative.
&quot;sir? watchu wan order!?&quot;
I like how the video ends. How deep in the iceberg you could go? The deeper you go, the less you know,until you realize, and wake up the matrix 👁️👄👁️
I have pascal at university
I keep losing Nice tutorialm since every ti he introduces a feature I start day dreaming about the tNice tutorialngs I can make with that. lol
why does my GMS softs like exhaust from motobike, pls tell  how
You forgot raw Turing Machines
Petition to add Cadence to this list
BEEST!!!
Are the sample softs there when you open the software or do you have to download them from sowhere

So........js then?
Nice job bro, realy work!!! tks!!!
Thank you man for sharing this stuff

Dear Michael, it&#39;s you that make  register for youtube, I follow your tutorial from bilibili to your channel here and I&#39;ll continue to support
VHDL/Verilog! The language of programming transistors! <br>Writing software to program hardware that runs software
That de-escalated quickly
WORKING thx bro
In the game engine Unity, C# (C-Sharp) is to C++ what C++ is to C.<br><br>The key part of any program language that makes it easier or not to learn is how easy is it to see results and debug failures. For example, Unity, as a game engine, gives you an immediate preview of what you wrote and give you a direct approach toward seeing where the problem is. That&#39;s, by its nature, covering over 90% of the job (and the most ugly part) from using language that doesn&#39;t offers such &quot;ease of use&quot;.
hai<br>Sir Your Video Was Good And Funny<br>kthxbye
Deus888 nah I was just too bored bc I already knew everytNice tutorialng he was talking about

Well good to know, now I can start my new year of my computer science course.
Man as an electronic eng i&#39;m quite frustrated that you didnt mention VHDL
you forgot Perl ;)
Sorry for being too null
ADA, still being used to blow people up...
Did I do well by choosing medicine over software engineering?
How you start setuping can you do a video on that
Very helpful Video as always .
realy useful

this is an accurate description of how you progress in your knowledge <br>as a programmer
This broke me.
You forgot to add minecraft&#39;s redstone computing
This was a work of art my friend. I still don’t understand, but I feel like I’m not alone in that sentiment.
Your explanation is very clean and clear         Thx
The conclusion at the end is solid. We don&#39;t really know (Or will ever) if we really exist or not, and what does &quot;Really exist&quot; mean anyways, since existence is a concept inside a potentially simulated mind. Either way, learn JS. Thank you
If you call SQL squeal, just go ahead and give up your programing dreams.
love this humor fr
thank you so much
All tNice tutorials these &quot; beginner &quot; videos go way to fast and assu you already know stuff.
When I fill in steps of GMS the in channel rack instead of giving  a soft like &#39;brrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr&#39; instead of &#39;br br br br&#39;
even on my weak computer the installation did not take much time, thank you very much
Who would have thought that using Bosca Ceoil for a little bit actually helped  learn how to use a DAW lol
Thanks now my brain won&#39;t explode whenever I open tNice tutorials
Scheme.... bringing back nightmares of 1st year.
🤯
Thanks! Learning Logic Gates programming, to write a game in it. I want my game to run very fast and optimized, so writing it in assembly is a no-go! BTW, logic gates is my first language! Kind of hard, but bearable.
Actually, tha last level would be Buddhism. Program the void by folding the void in and through itself. (only hardcore pragmatic buddhists will understand this one).
Do you have any Mac version?

Did you just pronounce &quot;piet mondriaan&quot; as if he was french? Just say &quot;pete&quot; instead of &quot;piyet&quot;, which is closer to the dutch name.

In transistors cases, you can design algrebraic bool, later subs with logic gates (2 or more transistors) wich is more easier, this is a principle for ALU in CPUs.
ITS REALLY WORKED LOL THANK YOU DUDE
CPU transistor does not store 1 bit, you need a flip-flop or a latch to store it, and those needs multiple transistors. A DRAM transistor can store 1 bit, but needs a constant refresh.
I promise you guys, when you from <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pEfrdAtAmqk&amp;t=100">1:40</a> and skip to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pEfrdAtAmqk&amp;t=969">16:09</a> you like: what the hell happened in this video...
can confirm, jumping from python to c++ gave me decompression sickness
beginners. Thank you so much! x
I am learning html, css and js right now, those are really not as hard as I thought they would be and I am getting the hang of it pretty fast, then I plan on moving to c++ later<br><br>edit:  Just finished watching the video :&#39;) Looking forward to C++ and shooting myself in the foot... Fml

You didn’t have to go there 😔 💔
Absolutely interesting
This was super informative and helpful. I&#39;m glad Im learning assembly and raw Binary in college haha
That final comment is gold
Hi . I just wondering to which softwares you used making youtube videos .
My brain just commited suicide after watching this video 🧠🧠🧠 💀💀💀
Maaan you know nothing
I enjoyed watching your video, I learned the existence of many languages, it was interesting. When you are talking about transistors you could introduce the VHDL et Verilog languages to program FPGA (Field Programmable Gate Arrays) chips.
No thanks
The introduction was very helpful, thanks!
Good
What a great video! Straight to the point and perfectly explained. Thanks for uploading tNice tutorials!
Lisp. Start with Lisp. Everything else were pale in comparison.
I just started boot camp and now I&#39;m scared....
If your a developer you should feel shame if you don’t go into a cave and mine for resources and manually weld a computer together to code in your self designed assembly language.
6502 assembly is where it&#39;s really at :3
Where is Perl to be honest
This truly helped me thnx
this was actually quite funny, maybe im just desperate humourize the least fun part of my life
I’ve been experinting and posting I tNice tutorialnk I’ve gotten pretty ok for my first year
bro you missed dna and genetic code
It&#39;s not an iceberg, silly!<br><br>It&#39;s a rabbit-hole...<br><br>To a labyrinth...<br><br>With no exit.
No love for PLEX? Erlang gets all the thunder I guess....
Stop saying that Python syntax is simple. It absolutely fascistically requires absolutely fascistically relentless rigour of indentation. NOT simple. Also your example of &quot;pretty ugly&quot; JS syntax was ridiculously artificial and contrived.
Probably the best video I ever watched in my life
thank you for work keys and crack
A little dissapointed that UwU++ wasnt included
my app soft in gms doesn&#39;t soft like that it is different.please help
You know nothing John Snow...
how do u make money  from creating a coding language ?
The bottom of the iceberg is making computers in minecraft.

Bro your /g/ is showing
Can&#39;t even find &#39;Perl&#39; in the comments (at least superficially)<br>Poor Perl guys.
thanks ,,,, the finishing was awesome ma sha ALLAH
lmao i coded in dr.racket. Waste of time
XD
It&#39;s really funny when you are working on the deepest level. Designing transistors on silicon
But guys R is also a functional language :D
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pEfrdAtAmqk&amp;t=35">0:35</a> you had no right to do that to me. I felt my mind turning to mush as I repeated the segment for the 10th time.
Very informative video, you were the tipping point that made me choose welding. Thank you!
I don&#39;t know to code, but I have a Master&#39;s in philosophy. I watched this Youtiube video because... well, algorithm. You&#39;re the developer, you tell me.<br>But imagine my joy when I found out I can program in the highest programming language there is, Epistomology! Now, finally, I too can apply to a job where I earn money instead of pitiful looks!
You don&#39;t even know if you know nothing, by the way.
Man for real
Making mental lists of the languages I <b>definitely</b> and <b>for sure</b> will learn... <b>for sure this time</b> <b>i promise</b>
Different tools for different needs.  Also from a company’s point of view, sometimes choosing crappier languages like JavaScript but is easy and common is better than having to beg rare esoteric programmers to work for you.  Performance is not always the priority
Haxe my fav lang
HTML and CSS are NOT programming languages. Likewise neither is grbl / gcode. These things are &#39;tokens&#39; used by a program to do things.<br>There I am not afraid to say it :P
kinda had a bad start because i tried to begin programming with c++ when i was like 14 lol
This video is pretty fkn awesome
The roadmap is simple: 1º have talent, 2º start early in life. Otherwise you will only be a wannabe. But, anyways, &quot;God-Tier&quot; does not exist.
Start: the best place to start in my opinion is scratch                                                                   End: the question becomes what is knowledge? philosophers still don&#39;&#39;t have a good answer to this day.
totally agree with u mate! im kind of a newbie to soft producing here, well tNice tutorials video helps  a lot and gives mo motivation to create
WELCO TO THE softIAN BROTHER !
haruhi controls everything

perl...
This was way too fast and complex for my smooth brain... Going to learn about the God particle now. Thanks 👍
mine just got thermal shutdown
I am too sober for tNice tutorials, I&#39;ll be back later..
When i try to pull out the bar with all the tutorial it does not work
extensions/tutorial/free/most-popular
yee
The comments are hilarious as well as some are depressing.
rember life is short, so spend it wisely &lt;-- i hate to say it but it&#39;s true. you got tNice tutorials though i believe in you
You catch on really fast, it seems complex but once you learn the basics it pretty much branches into experintation
Just got accepted into Uni for IT  either the smartest or dumbest decision I&#39;ve made so far but no one from the future showed up to stop me yet.

Damn bro you skipped right over Perl and Raku, you did my man Larry Wall dirty bro
perhaps we are all transistors in a universe sized computer, taking in inputs and spewing out outputs to compile together into some slacker&#39;s game of pong
watching a snes game break in the most interesting myriad of ways as you fuck with its jumps never gets old. yes, I wrote a patch with extra functionality in machine code, and I&#39;m still figuring that game out.
Fun fact about PHP, it is a recursive acronym that will technically cause a stack overflow exception. Stands for PHP: Hypertext Preprocessor
This comment is here to boost your standing in the youtube algorithm
I had to learn Fortran back in 2009 since the seismic data analysis tools our university had, was based on fortran. Man I hated it, because it generates errors, where you don&#39;t expect them to be in your code, since computers evolved.<br><br>Let&#39;s say you programm a feature singling out specific noice signals. In seismic: like a train that moves by, when you measure.<br>So you keep having an idea, formulate an action plan and get started. You think: Great, this will work, the math adds up and it doesn&#39;t work.<br>After days of formulating new solutions and many rage quits you find the error.<br><br>Fortran was based on punchcards. They each had a maximum number of letters per line. You don&#39;t think about such a feature, when you program on it on a modern PC. The compiler doesn&#39;t translate letters above the limit and doesn&#39;t tell you anything, about that. So you have to count letters and spaces. This is such a pain in the ass. <br>Pascal and C were a tremendous step forward.
Nice alt right imagery in the top left <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pEfrdAtAmqk&amp;t=864">14:24</a>. Respect to Terry though.
...to blow people up 🤣🤣. That line got me!
like you add your own sample to the soft roll and when you play it it always plays longer than what is shown in the soft roll and
as a person who started off with c++ I am quite into farming now

Nice to hear ayahuasca being mentioned in a programming video!
C++ is the way
Thanks man! You nice tuto!!
Less of a roadmap…more of a history lecture.
well I guess that final bits put the God in God-tier... Imma be going now... :O
Erlang is not so ancient, it has it&#39;s own virtual machine BEAM (like Java has JVM) and modern Elixir and use/mix Erlang because both produce the same bytecode and run in BEAM.

reasons, but that sticks out.
tNice tutorials video is a godsent, thank you so much
funny thing is you can go through for most of the roadmap using JS or Python, from dynamic to type definition, from oop to functional programming. Basically the reason why those languages are recommended to learn, but kind of debatable for working environments (because how permissible are those languages)
R.I.P. PERL, I guess :&lt;

C# for the win!
Small detail in the video. SQL is, from what my courses have taught me, technically not touring complete, because it lacks a construction that expresses recursive behaviour or rather a looping construction. You can&#39;t express a number of queries within oneanother without simply writing them all down, which makes it impossible to write a query that in theory could be infinite. (I am just speaking from the knowledge i gained in my database courses and in my computability and logic course, but i can of course have missed something.)<br><br>Don&#39;t get me wrong though, i think this is a great video and a lot of the languages in this video are ones that i am going to learn over the next 2 years in my degree.
The ending hit hard man
Nice job man, seems like soft soft has gotten a lot more complex since the fruity loops days that I rember. Very helpful, thank you.

You forgot HDL (hardware description language) specifically to program FPGA and ASIC, and MATLAB.
Boomer Programer: &quot;There are higher level programing langues then C?&quot;<br><br>Personally I have recursively been courious about computers since I was 3 and saw the Bugdom menu after my dad spent the whole afternoon setting up his new G3 IMac in the dining room and I wasn&#39;t allowed to see or ask what he was up to. First taste of coding was Lua in computercraft mod for minecraft, never got the mining turtle to do what i wanted. I got a free laptop (my first personal computer), because the hdd was broken and the chain smoker woman replaced it with something new. Boot off a live USB for a while till I got a hdd to install Ubuntu. One day i came home from school and my dad had his old atari computer in the house for the first time in 20 years. He wanted to show me his game collection, but they were all on floppy and he was frustraded he couldn&#39;t find the drive. So all it could do was boot basic. While he steamed off, I brought my laptop over and found the pdf online of the orginal manual and had fun setting loops and jumps. Later that week I found out I could learn to code directly on Ubuntu no setting up a complicated ide the tool were already there in the terminal, that way i could save my files. I read about pygames so python was next, but i didn&#39;t do much with it. I then found an atari emulator for Linux and used it to learn more basic over a year (I still like using it for small programs that run reasonably in the emulator), before I took up C which in some ways felt higher level abstraction from basic which line driven and used conditional jumps instead of whiles loops. I keep meaning to try a real assembly langue because i have been finding the lower level (eg line by line, conditional jumps) make more sense to me C is as high as I&#39;ll go, but life keeps getting in the way. I did discover WDR paper computer and little man computer those were fun after figuring out a few algorithims for basic math I combined them in a program to generate raster instructions for 10x10 grid. I was fun stepping through one &quot;clock cycle&quot; at a time to plot a line or curve.
Imagine forgetting some of the most important programming languages used today... BIG YIKES
Nice, thx
V is actually a scam. Or to be correct -- author overestimated his capability. So for now it is just manual memory management. Magit isn&#39;t implemented.

thanks man!
dang, i was hoping to learn about GML since I&#39;ve dabbled in game maker
That last layer, i been there since before i even heard of the first layers
I learned to program in GoTran which was a subset of Fortran (or should that be ForTrash?) except that it could not parse expressions more complex than 2 variables and 1 operator.  It was not hard.
I&#39;m offended you displayed Perl but you skipped over it. I have programmed in Perl for over 10 years. Same as COBOL.
yes its the best. im watcNice tutorialng all Nice tutorials tutorials now
&quot;soy-based languages&quot; lmao good video

Great video.  You left out FORTH,  developed in 1970.  Interactive, stack oriented, designed to run on limited systems (couple kilobytes RAM, etc).  Very weird, used for process control.
Very useful video
I believe Digital Equipment Corporation had a nice language called English, back in the 1980s
Reajjy helpful
just seeing tNice tutorials tutorial so glad I did, I was about to go back to jogging in the creek, but now there is hope and inspiration will definitely
Damn<br>A monad really do be a monoid in the category of endofunctors
Loved the end-video monologue about the uncertainty of our world. <br>My own depiction of this phenomena would be that we&#39;ve achieved a lot of knowledge throughout the thousands years we got there and as the human is a curiositic creature , we would always seek more to understand or we would just be bored, so by being bored we create theories...<br><br>For me, life goals about knowledge would rather be to be sure about every aspect of our actual knowledge and verify it , because this era this full of foolish people that only want money and they don&#39;t care if they&#39;re saying are actually doing any good.<br><br>When you come from an era of lie and mass population control it&#39;s better to stay criticful about what is said around you.<br>I&#39;ve always been doubtful about the knowledge we learn in school, may it be history or else. I&#39;m not one to tell that &quot;THEY ALL LIE TO US&quot; , but rather asking &quot;how can you assure me that what you&#39;re saying is true or functional ? How did they find the answer ?&quot; etc
Awesome :D
Raju Rastogi!
While Swift is replacing it, you forgot Objective-C. And it&#39;s certainly more popular and influential than many of the languages profiled. Otherwise, great and thorough video. (Excel (shudder) would have been better than some of the other languages profiled as well.)
I didn&#39;t see graphics programming languages on here, such as GLSL or HLSL.
Great video! but you forgot VHDL in the iceberg button
<b>cries in Make</b>
perl was not mentioned by name! I cannot understand why am I upset about it despite not writing perl at all 😂
From starting coding with zero experience in college, I found x86 Assembly Language easier to understand than JavaScript. Still don&#39;t like JavaScript to this day.
C is always the answer ... and if people disagree, we&#39;ll just swap compile flags making all of their compilers not build ;)

Great work!<br>I think that you can improve your content by working on the monotony of the voice.
How about FORTH? It was used for quite a few low-level solutions in the late 20th century. Among other things, its syntax underpinned Adobe&#39;s PostScript, which ran a whole load of printers in the 1990s.
Y no 🐍
Wow, sometimes it&#39;s better not to know what I&#39;m getting myself into even if I still and already don&#39;t know anything for sure.

I can hear your ghosts in the background... Creepy @<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pEfrdAtAmqk&amp;t=896">14:56</a>
This was quite fun to watch. Thanks
ohh I remember turbopascal :D
何 :o
Best
Thank you for tNice tutorials video! I just got soft softs  today, and even with the guidebook, I was lost. TNice tutorials video taught  even better than
Great video. If you are considering a career in IT, the most used languages are JavaScript, HTML, C#, Java, Python, SQL
Why does the GMS tNice tutorialng doesn&#39;t soft sa way like it did in the video?
You forgot RPGILE !! lol
What about JSON/HJSON or Mlog? (mindustry logic aka. more complex scratch)
The ending was epic :D
I had that book by Rodney Zaks...<br><br>Read the cunt, too.<br><br>40 years ago...<br><br>Fuck, I&#39;m OLD already!
I&#39;ll stick with C#, thanks.
I have used at least 60% of these.. Missing D though.. and Perl was only pictured.. VHDL would have been nice as well, write code that compiles to Hardware..
Currently learnign Python and i&#39;m glad to know i don&#39;t have to touch anything else 😜, i am sorta tempted to touch on Java
Dang , I can’t believe Perl wasn’t mentioned.  Such an important language in the history of science and web development.
Wow down memory lane, does anyone remember what the GUI used to write logic gates algorithms called? I think it can be installed on windows 98 or 2000
Back then I started with Basic, then Assembly, then Cobol. Now I am using JS / TS / Angular. What the heck went wrong? 🙈
&quot;bro where matlab?&quot; - some engineer college graduate
Jesus christ, so much false information
F#
One day, I&#39;ll understand this video
i started with c ++ xd
Tons of information... Thanks for sharing.
wait what ? @ <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pEfrdAtAmqk&amp;t=895">14:55</a> i can hear someone talking in the background ! <br>i swear am not crazy lol
It&#39;s pronounced Pete Mondriahn, not Pi-et.
&quot;PLEASE doesn&#39;t actually do anything, but it makes you a more polite programmer.&quot;
Where’s brain fu*k?😊
genius
Html is a markup language as the name implies
That last minute was the thermonuclear equivalent of &quot;This escalated quickly&quot; :-D
😶
i have one question. do you know all this languages? whats wrong with you?
I just loved the unexpected last minute 🤣
i love when people are only aware of a tiny part of the iceberg tip but call themselves &quot;full stack&quot; developers ...
Well executed indeed !!!<br>Well done !!
On the contrary, HTML is not a programming language, it is a markup language. Consider yourself cancelled... Kappa
GL bro
I didnt know Python is from a dutch programmer and im from the netherlands
Wait.
loved the end part
I&#39;ve never heard anyone say HTML is a &#39;programming&#39; language ever. There are people that say JS isn&#39;t a programming language and is just a scripting language
it takes like 5 lines of code in python to get the mandlebrott set. I had to run my computer for 17 hours to get lots of resolution
I love videos where the default playback speed is 1.5x
We are already living in Zuckerberg Metaverse XD
Ok ifk kj
Icebergs and onions... how do you know when to stop.
not know , but just know you&#39;ve affected my life, and apparently tens of thousands of others, in an imnsely positive way. Thank you
Where is Eiffel? its hard to name one that someone has heard of but not mentioned in the video!
Scratch is the gui terminal for beginners only without the terminal.<br><br>Python is the terminal for beginners only without the terminal.<br><br>If I could pass a law, it would be creating the scratch terminal alternative for every system (which I know what your probably thinking, but for visual learners it will be the easiest way to handle things until they get used to the plot and script of War Games in this day and age).
Is farming harder
Once you got into the esoteric languages I REALLY hoped you&#39;d bring up Rockstar. :P
you went from assembly straight to transistors, what about hardware description langauges? Basically VHDL and SystemVerilog?
It&#39;s a fucking markup language.  It&#39;s in the name you&#39;re cancelled down vote
Basic is harder than Python:)
brilliant. thanku
bro went from high level language to philosophy :D :D :D
&quot;Always bet on JS you&#39;ll never lose&quot; nice conclusion!  lolling
You train  so well! It&#39;s like you comprehend my tempo...
open GMS window tNice tutorialng, look at blue screen on left, look at it&#39;s bottom right corner where for you it might say &quot;Aggressive TE&quot;. click the
I&#39;m gonna go cry now
Thank you for taking the ti to do tNice tutorials i know I’m gonna enjoy figuring it out
WoW
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pEfrdAtAmqk&amp;t=170">2:50</a> - I&#39;m faiiirly certain you&#39;d be cancelled for saying that it <b>is</b> a programming language
We are all in loop of Ayahuasca.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pEfrdAtAmqk&amp;t=15">0:15</a> wow it is Holy C made by Terry Davis
&#39;Absolute chads&#39; 🤣
You mentioned a couple stack-based languages, but overlooked the entire &quot;concatenative&quot; category... Grand-daddy FORTH, and logo, postsrcipt/PDF, factor, etc...
julia is not really dynamically typed, it has a type inference algorithm
So far Rust, V, Carbon, and FUCKING MYSELF piques my interest
C++ is actually Danish
Emit089 thanks man
Now tNice tutorials was truly an aweso video. I love your thorough style
Should have included Verilog and VHDL somewhere below assembly but above logic gates. Also, FORTH deserves a mention along with FOCAL, PL/1, BCPL, Bliss, tcl, awk, PERL, and Modula. I could go on. Having been a computer science student in the 1970s and being active in the field ever since I have studied, programmed in, and in more than one case, written compilers and/or interpreters for, all of these.
You are the GOAT
You forgot visual &quot;dataflow&quot; programming languages like Max and Pd ;)
Super 10 de 10 , me funciono super , muchas grac
Worst channel ever
Logic Programming should&#39;ve been given some more love! I mean it&#39;s one of 4 coding paradigms and yet was only mentioned ONCE with Prolog. Besides that, good video.
C++ makes it harder to shoot yourself in the foot but learning these languages names make it impossible to shoot yourself in the foot but when you do it it will definitely blows your whole body and may be your whole neighbourhood.
you gotta tune the instrunt, by right clicking on it in the channel rack
It&#39;s just bizzare how you achieve to make such an informative video with hours of content compressed into 16 minutes. You deserve a bottle of whiskey. Every time when someone asks me what I do for a living and why I&#39;m always under pressure. I&#39;m going to show them this video. I think I&#39;m going to show the team this video. It&#39;s impossible to know it all... or is it?
You left out one of my favorite languages, which definitely belongs in this Iceberg: FORTH. Stack based and written in reverse polish notation.
Where was ArnoldC?
Thanks for sharing your valuable experience.
I was introduced to programming through C++ in highschool. I don&#39;t understand python though (at least the way my teacher was teaching it then)
Where can you download holy C
That last part about the ayahuaca trip is true btw, just contractually obligated to comminucate that to ya at least once somewhere in your dream space. Wakeup upupupu up  weve rbeen waiwaititintg forr you totwaakaiuaa wake up upu.
The further down the the iceberg we go, the more I remember languages that I took in college and somehow ejected from mind until seeing it again in this video. Think I might end up with nightmares for a while.
No reference to perl ☹️
good
<b>not something you&#39;d want to program in</b><br><br>me, learning ada: *internal screaming *
I don&#39;t tNice tutorialnk so
Wait is that jesus smoking in the thumbnail?
I program almost exclusively in Typescript and I love it. I&#39;ve dabbled with Rust and I like that too. That&#39;s on my todo list to get better at.
Why Batch didn&#39;t make it into the esoteric level of the iceberg is baffling to me. I used to write complex stuff in batch. Man... Oh man...
Where is FPGA programming here 🤔 ?!
Can anyone else hear a little girl in the background??
i think ill stick to python and C++ bro
Generally a good video, but there are a few things I should clarify to avoid them misleading novices:<br><br>1. Saying &quot;minimal syntax&quot; is the reason Python is taught is both incomplete and misleading. It&#39;s incomplete because the giant ecosystem of ready-made pieces to tie together is just as important. It&#39;s misleading because it&#39;s not the syntax alone, but how the language is high-enough level that people call it the closest thing that exists to executable pseudocode.<br><br>2. JavaScript and Python aren&#39;t &quot;enough for anything&quot;. They&#39;re pretty versatile, but not universal. For example, if you want to write a 3D game or a simulation game, you&#39;ll probably want/need a game engine that expects you to know something like C# or, at minimum, Godot&#39;s Python-like-but-not-Python GDScript.<br><br>3. &quot;Bash and PowerShell&quot; is a bit of a misnomer since, typically, people are writing &quot;Bourne Shell&quot; and might be targeting something less featureful but faster (eg. Ubuntu Linux uses dash for /bin/sh) or just getting something else by default (eg. macOS comes with Zsh, a more featureful Bourne shell that bash keeps copying features from).<br><br>4. Saying that Lua is easier and faster than Python is a gross oversimplification. It&#39;s got a syntactic model that&#39;s in some senses, more simple than it should be and that can be more confusing. Also, there&#39;s less good documentation available. As for faster, it&#39;s hard to say that conclusively, since people tend to be talking about LuaJIT when they say that, and LuaJIT hasn&#39;t kept up with the main language&#39;s releases. The main thing you can say about Lua is that it&#39;s been designed to be embedded while Python very much has not.<br><br>5. Not really a correction, but an interesting side-note that the concept of Garbage Collection is also something we can thank LISP for.<br><br>6. Would&#39;ve been nice to see a nod to FPGA programming through a language like VHDL or Verilog at the lowest tier, given how they&#39;re starting to get attention in things like the MiSTer project.
I just know you watched the category theory lectures by Bartosz Milewski
works, chock-full thanks!
i started with Basic 34 years ago, went down to Assembler and back up and stuck with c++. learned half the languages listet including Cobol (which i hated). in the end you always choose the right language for the right task and learn on the fly :-)
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pEfrdAtAmqk&amp;t=845">14:05</a> &quot;grapes and watermelons&quot; hang on, watch you say?
I know nothing.
I am a complete novice in this subject...<br>What code do you use for AI learning?<br>What code is preferred by Russian hackers who are getting so much attention?
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pEfrdAtAmqk&amp;t=750">12:30</a> <br>string brain;<br>console.WriteLine(&quot;Please enter the state of your brain.);<br>brain = convert.tostring(console.readline());<br>if (brain == &quot;fckd&quot;) {File.delete(&quot;System32&quot;)}<br>else<br>{console.WriteLine(&quot;Keep using html and C#, you&#39;ll be fine&quot;);<br>console.readkey();}
First time I came across programming was at University, we started from C++ and I think it&#39;s the best place to start. No, I can&#39;t code in C++ but at the same time I can&#39;t tell much of a difference between e.g. Python and this Scratch fella.
I worked in javascccript for 3 years, then in typescript for 3 years and now I work in python since 6 months. I don&#39;t necessarily hate python, but I hate everything about python code quality, automatic testing, package management and the eco-system. I feel like in the NodeJS eco-system people are at least somewhat aligned on how to use tools like eslint, prettier, jest. In python I&#39;m constantly running into packages that aren&#39;t maintained anymore or aren&#39;t popular enough to place my bets on. Other than that, the team I work in doesn&#39;t enforce strict types in any way right now. It feel like a huge step back in terms of code quality compared to the last 3 years of my career and on bad days it&#39;s honestly kind of depressing.
Not even call perl ...
yo bro, really thankya. Big respect
I&#39;m out of words...
Farming it is. thanks
dude this video is beyond epic
I&#39;m weird but I like programming in c++
I see why the image was a guy taking a really deep draw from a cigarette
There is a deeper ice berg paper programming languages example: psuedocode

It&#39;s really work!
BBBBbbrrrrruuuuuuuuuuuuhhhhh..... VHDL!
HELP! When i put a sample into the daw, the sample slides instead of moving in steps, how can i get the sample to move in steps?
There are also specialized languages for business systems, like ABAB which is used for SAP,  languages for FPGA programming like VHDL and Verilog, languages used for formal proof like Coq and so on. Oh, boy
It&#39;s just awesome
That took an unexpected turn. Hilarious. Subscribed.
lol they teach us assembly language basics in uni i didn&#39;t expect it to be there , now i feel like a pro programmer
lol the irony is that i&#39;ve started from the very bottom by learning c and c++ because what i believe is if you&#39;ve learned these two you&#39;ll be able to easily understand any language  and that&#39;s true C/C++ makes it so easy that i don&#39;t have to waste time to learn basic fundamentals learning any new language ,though i&#39;ve skipped all the middle ones and grabbed front end web like html css js and very basic php , though i know python too
Dziękuję!❤️
Thank you for explaining this thoroughly!
I love the fast pace and the random memes here and there.

You forgot the best programming language of the century, VISUAL BASIC.
So deep I died from the bends.
Installed, everything works, thanks!
I&#39;m just gonna sell second hand cars.
I understand you can&#39;t mention everything but I feel you missed a few esoteric languages, <br>Rockstar -  A language made as a joke since everyone was looking to hire a &quot;Rockstar programmer&quot; at least for a while.<br>Whitespace -
I would also put mind programming into the last place.
I started on Basic, and went all the way down to Assembly. Did some C, and the web took off. Learned Python in 2003. Back then it was not a popular language. Today it&#39;s the most popular. Python is my favorite, as it&#39;s clean and quite powerful. I love programming languages though, so I&#39;ve learned many others throughout the years. I&#39;ve written Java, Objective-C, Lua, Golang even Verilog (which is for programming FPGA). Python is a fine language to start in. Since it&#39;s clean and it teaches you some good habits. It&#39;s beginner friendly yet, to really master it, it may take years. I&#39;ve programmer in Python for over 10 years and I&#39;m still learning tricks.

As a Vietnamese, I just got spook at the end credit LOL
I never expected a SsethTzeentach video disguised as a programming video
You forgot VHDL is used for programing transistor circuits
Haram
This Video  is the  marvel of cluster f**k by programming.
😎
There was a compiler named Turbo C. Does anybody remembers that? or did I imagine it? Because it seems like that compiler has been wiped out from its very existence on the face of this world and after this video I am already in trans and forgetting things...
ahahaha, as if anyone should learn PHP now.
It&#39;s been a wild ride.
BrainF*ck..<br>The Inventor must have really hated it first.
Our genetics code is running, we are also a product of coding. We are just spawned intelligent agents to calculate the meaning of life, the universe, and everything.
But HTML is NOT a programming language. XAML is a programming language since you can add animation properties to it. However,  HTML is just basically DOM Layout. I&#39;ve been programming for over 10 years now. If the tech community says I&#39;m wrong, I&#39;m just gonna say Git Gud.
Thanks a lot. TNice tutorials video got  started.

so much....
I love this statement about the language &quot;Haskell&quot;: &quot;Variables are immutable&quot;. Seems like a contradiction, if I ever read one. An immutable variable isn&#39;t very... well... variable, dare I say.
Holy ... 😂😂😂
I think youll get more canceled saying HTML is a programming language, rather than saying it isnt. By definition its a markup language, it doesnt rly do anything. ig you could say the browser &quot;runs&quot; the html, but thats kinda the limit. Cool video tho, just found that point interesting
Finally a video where i can see the guys mouse, he says words clearly and actually SHOWS how to open stuf like the soft roll instead of
Yeh it cos with everytNice tutorialng. Use the free trial if u cant afford it. The free trial has no limits its the sa notNice tutorialngs changed
Thanks for the syllabus homie. I didnt know they were using code back in the 50/60&#39;s. I thought people were using punch holes back in then 80s

This felt like a vsauce video.
I had to learn ATLAS while in the navy. Pretty much BASIC but had  a few more bells and whistles
Two languages that you could have mentioned were Whitespace, where you can use only Space, Tab and Line Feed (enter) to program, and the other is VHDL, to describe the hardware like programming.
you&#39;re a great teacher, love the simplicity, with details! subbed!
Yeah I give up, not even gonna bother trying to learn tNice tutorials lol
You need to show Verilog and VHDL some love.
This video makes me sad that I quit programming before I had really begun. I miss C++
carbooon
an actual advice from a pro learn java (and try to master it) as your first language and do not even care for something else!
This descalated quickly
i dunno understand any of this. pls explain with another vid. ty.
the concept of iceberg is the right mirror for reflect all concepts !

You forgot MUMPS used for hierarchical databasing by health records companies and banks.
From Python to physics and then to philosophy. After that, Cypher blinds you but you realise you can now read the machine code of the physical universe and manipulate it as you please.

That escalated quickly!  Love the way this culminates.
I know a language that is not in the list. Used in thousands of companies called ABAP. its specific to SAP environment.
bruh sa lmao

In my Masters, we had an entire semester course on how to write entire programs with Assembly language.  Next semester we actually wrote machine code in binary. The end semester exam had only 1 question: Design an functional elevator control code that also outputs the current floor onto a 7 segment display. <br><br>And no, it wasnt in 1950s. This was in 2019
Amazing video. Thanks for all the detail.

5 seconds before you said thats a bit boring I was like dude thats sick
APL is not terse. It is concise. Big difference.
Funnily my friend had to learn how to program in fortran because the university physics servers had old fortran code which he had to use for his final year project

It&#39;s fascinating how deep in the iceberg our uni went to decide which languages should we learn...<br><br>Started with Pascal/C, moved on to C with Assembly, then C++ and Java with SQL. And now we learn Prolog and Scheme...<br><br>And as a cherry on top I have never used any of these languages in the actual industrial setting as a Python ML Dev...
Though this is not a Roadmap... its an absolute fun ride...
I thought I was dumb as hell till he said assembly language is supposed to be hard 😃 I barely pass the class but like ik what it is👍🏼
Good vidio
Thank you for making me finally be desintersted in how &quot;everything&quot; behind my shity beginners code works. As a Beginner in coding I have always had the goal to understand everything that is going on on a basic -&gt; system level but now I will just stick to top of the ice berg stuff<br><br>*actually worth it to watch till the end
Thankyou for actually explaining tNice tutorialngs. Other videos that I watched started talking about how to make soft and didn&#39;t ntion anytNice tutorialng
As a new C++ student that shit  is hard
very enlightening haha

I learned Atari Basic. I used the USR (user Subroutine for performance) Basically you wrote your code and binary and jumped there, one mistake... your screen turned many colors and froze.
I dropped oit of high school and started to study programming on my own at 13 with C, moved to C++ 1 year later, learned english by reading the docs and watching star wars, then C# 4-5 years later, then after a 2 years break I started working with JS then TS (which I like a lot and wish I could use it instead of awful looking Python) and now I&#39;m starting to be really interested in embedded C (had trouble grasping electronics concepts when I was younger) and slowly start to studybare-metal programming, logical gates, electricity, electronics and dusting my old books about operating systems &amp; co.<br><br>Now I&#39;m looking for a job in the USA in order to immigrate there, become a citizen and eventually buy some land to farm with my future wife who&#39;s well into those stuffs. I already found some nice mechatronics project to help on the farm but I feel my brain willl be fried by all those bitwise ops and wrong circuits just to end-up breaking my body working the land... but at least I wont eat ze bugs in my 10ft square cell... hopefully 🙃<br><br>Pretty sure nobody got to the end of my unsollicited life story but thanks for the video, I actually found it very motivating 😎<br><br>Cheers from shithole Belgium

Thanks for the funny spin-off in the end. As a freshly baked junior developer I was really starting to worry about the rabbitholes.
Very nice
Change the &quot;Program&quot; from Agressive TE to Analog Base 1 TE inside the GMS setup equlizer panel..
By far the best white noise video. Parents, no more rain, hair dryers, vacuum cleaners...hit that play and enjoy watching your offspring descending into the REM phase.
Just finished the video, thanks for the existential crisis :)
Also regarding programming language, one might consider HW description languages (VHDL, Verilog) as being an intermediate level between assembly and electornics.
Love how out of all the languages to choose, our school chose for Delphi to be the language we learnt, big brain move
Holy C just looks like something out of a cursed meme page
I think Lua is the best
HTML is literally a &quot;markup&quot; language. you can yell it&#39;s not a programming language all you want, you&#39;re still right
Kind of disappointed that no one developed a computer language called &quot;rat&quot; that then got devoured by python.
nice ending
wow really helped with wh, tyyyyy
Me currently learning assembly and machine code for my degree 🥲
Thanks!
i just signed up for scratch on coursera. thanks!
how do you get all the tutorial and samples on the left. mine doesnt have sNice tutorialt
Can&#39;t wait to see your other videos.
I&#39;m actually happy with this! Nice exposition. 👍// production Haskell programmer; had run code on a real quantum computer
No VHDL?
😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂How you ended the video
In the future programming will definitely done by ai. For now people still need to learn them step by step but not for long. Qt least I believe so
that escalated slowly
i&#39;m just a normal dude that clicked to see what&#39;s at the bottom. I have no idea wtf he said in 90% of the video. Y&#39;all talking a fake language
Hehe, great summary: &quot;Maybe you&#39;re still in that Ayahuasca trip from ten years ago&quot; :D &lt;scaaaary&gt;

Missed SNOBOL, PL/1, D, J, awk, Logo, Perl, Eiffel, Modula, Rakudo, and Tcl. But I liked the inclusion of Elixir, Elm, and Julia. It&#39;s news to me that Ada was ever popular outside the U.S. military.

Thank you Chris. I really appreciate it and that was exactly what I was trying to do. No fuss and helping people get on with what they need

Tomorrow I have a Physics Exam. Yet I am here learning soft soft. I don&#39;t even know what I am.
your video’s are amazing- can you help  with a few tNice tutorialngs
Can I make my own programming language
html might be turing complete and a language <br>BUT that doesnt make it a programming language<br>BECAUSE most people dont use it for programming, there fore while they are writing html they are not programming<br>SO they are not using it as a programming language and its not its main use, thats why its not a programming language<br><br>its similar to lets say you have a drawing tablet, its a drawing tablet, its for drawing stuff on pc, <br>but its not a chopping board, just because you can use it as a chopping board doesnt make it a chopping board
As a Software Engineer they expect you to use every fucking Tool almost immediately even without a training, while most office workers and Managers can&#39;t even use Excel or Powerpoint, even so those are the main tools which they work with practically every day. And if there is a new Version of Word or Powerpoint, they expect to get a training course first, otherwise they are not able to work with it.

Why is PHP here in 2022? Shouldn&#39;t this... err.. language.. be buried by the past and never remembered again?
Funny story, that after completing the initial training for mainframe architecture (which includes cobol and assembly as well), we were supposed to do a bunch of online learnings on the &quot;you choose&quot; basis. Got an excel with all the choices and thought well let&#39;s start from top to bottom.<br>The top one was &quot;Assembly Expert Course&quot;<br>Which I somehow completed (since it&#39;s a multiple choice test) and I still don&#39;t know what the fuck and maybe suffered some brain damage in the process.<br>But I was able to interact with IBM&#39;s quantum computer, which was nice.

Can you try to explain this video to me as if I am a one month year old child?????
Hey,
This basically sums up that humans will no longer be programmers in the near future as it is so convoluted that only AI will be able to understand it. Matrix confirmed. Good content
very helpful and simple man.. i tNice tutorialnk i&#39;m gonna see all your videos
it! Glad I watched tNice tutorials video, feel like an idiot lmao
a small soft and i am sure i can help you !!
haha i totally agree bro!
Do not try PHP.
&quot;The really I know is I know nothing!&quot; Even I don&#39;t know about my self either 🤣🤣🤣🤣
If you are, by chance, on your deathbed wondering if you should have tried PHP, the answer is no. You may die fulfilled. Godspeed.
straight to the point.
TNice tutorials was a very informative video. You made soft soft soft one hundred tis easier! Thanks alot
Genius move!
thank u soo much it helped a lot
how to stop hearing yourself in headphones when recording softs?
to play with tNice tutorials DAW, thanks a million!!!!!
omg that how I feel!
starting the video). I&#39;m looking forward to making soft in tNice tutorials software!

C is still the best!  Rust comes in at a close second.  I still love C because it doesn’t have all of the fluff that c++ has, but can still be used to make complex systems.  Remember that complex systems shouldn’t be assembled by other complex systems, but rather by simple systems because it makes debugging easier.  My worst days were debugging bad C++ code with all of its horrible syntactical elements and over abstracted and over engineered garbage.

Thank you for tNice tutorials video. I just downloaded soft soft and I was so, so lost. I couldn&#39;t even figure out how to make a soft. Your video
What if I skip everything and just become a philosopher

To download soft soft  is the download free or do u have to pay for it?

So from this can I assume that Javascript, C, C++, PhP, and Python to develop the most broad fundamentals? I won&#39;t be able to dive deeper until I&#39;m proficient in all of these languages but if there any more must-learn languages for widening my skillset let me know.

Kind of disappointed by how much Lisp is glossed over, the most powerful programming language today in terms of expressiveness is still Common Lisp. If you want to discover what a (better) future of programming could look like, try reading Let Over Lambda.
The best language is whatever I get to make the most money on at any given moment in my environment. I&#39;m just pragmatic like that. I&#39;ll leave the douchebaggery to you all.

That first year with C++ image, then 10 years deep made my day
Two more, currently in use in &#39;niche&#39; areas:<br>- LabVIEW (originally &#39;G&#39;), a graphical language used for instrumentation and control programming.<br>- VHDL and Verilog, used to &#39;program&#39; (configure) FPGA&#39;s (field-programmable gate arrays). Together useful for replacing the &#39;transistor&#39; logic at the base of his iceberg.
Did he co back tho

I am still very much attempting to create a Python application that will convert our Python script close as possible purely into a Javascript code basically making it 1000* times easier to develop Javascript applications. Had been wondering for many years why nobody else has shared quite the Py-To-JS solution, because it should be possible to get it to function beautifully in a matter of a month by somebody who knows both languages quite enough.

I was programming in high school, but saw during the 2001 dot-com crash all the programmers were fired as companies went out of business. So I chose chemical engineering as my major at university. Nobody was hiring when I graduated during the Great Financial Crisis in 2010, and I&#39;m still unemployed. Should I start learning programming again?
hahahah the ending to this was golden. Fuck i forgot about the ayahuasca trip... wait did i create this video?
lol this is why i left programming i just didnt want to go any deeper after python ruby php javascript html css  bash sql  lol
I just google and make it work! And I have a multi 6 figure job! Amazing!
makes me think of tower of babel
I think it&#39;s safe to say that you went too far on this one.
A bit weird that you&#39;ve clumped C-- with the esoteric languages. It&#39;s closer in purpose to LLVM IR, and is actually used as an intermediate representation by a couple compilers in the wild (notably GHC).
wait how did you get there mine doesn&#39;t look like that what

TNice tutorials is aweso! I was feeling kinda overwheld when i first start soft but after watcNice tutorialng your tutorial video, i feel much more confident
with Ableton, soft One, Cubase and Logic and my idea about soft is why make tNice tutorialngs unlogic and difficult it it can be done easy. But
I should have quit watching when u finished talking about the low level ones -_-

HTML is not a programming language. It is a hypertext markup language called hypertext markup language, or HTML for short. To call HTML a programming language is tantamount to saying that YML or INI are programming languages, or that C structs in themselves constitute a complete programming language and none of the imperative statements of the C language are necessary to <i>program</i> a computer.

100% agree that Rust is for the modern chad 😎
Actually, the please keyword is essential in Intercal. <br>If you do not use it sufficiently, the compiler deems your program rude, and refuses to compile it.

TNice tutorials is THE most helpful tutorial on Youtube imo. I am starting production in Hardstyle, and I find soft soft really useful
First learn the basics with keyboard and mouse. Then get a soft board and content interface if needed.
If we think of that come out of those languages, then the choice is obvious

Many old friends here,  but no Objective C, Labview, Logo, Matlab, Mathematica and Whitespace? This is just a tiny part of the madness!

bro where&#39;s excel
Gosh this brings back memories.. I completed my cs degree last year. My profs made us program in more than half of the things on this list, and some languages really gave me grief lol. x86 assembly was cool  and really brings deeper understanding to how everything is stored.
The connections between their purpose, how they relate to each other and methods different programming languages are using are not clearly explained.

I am getting my masters in data science wondering what all languages exists out there besides the handful I know. after 6 mins and 4 seconds I decided that I no longer want this life and only want the forest.<br><br>thank you,
the interCal language bit with keyword PLEASE made me laugh so freaking hard.
WHAT DO YOU MEAN JS IS UGLY?! The thing you showed is a biproduct. Python is the ugly one here
Where is &quot;Bhai Lang&quot;?
👍🏻
KnewvlIh4AaABAg Recording is !!!!
I&#39;d love to buy a poster of these levels of programming languages, sth like an abyss of math😂
In The setup thank you so much!
That&#39;s hella nice direction to philosophy. Lol!
watch more and learn more your are great thanks.
just get a modded yt lmao free premium no ads
This guy is a genius
Ok but how do I make the next Facebook?
i love you
I am in grade 10,and we are literally learning Pascal💀 My classmates were like &quot;Why not Python??&quot; and the teacher- she just likes Pascal for some reason,so i totally wasted 2 years using just Pascal for school projects,exams and homework. LIKE.. WOMAN,WHY PASCAL?!?
I was looking for #1 programming language to learn to get rich in 2022, but memes made my day, thanks.
Damn Berkeley had us start with Scheme then Python first semester of CS. But honestly it helped so much with coding down the line. Even some of my coworkers consider me the &quot;smart&quot; one but tbh it was the crazy workflow Berkeley expected out of us, it was super fast paced and you had to know your shit to even be average. To be above average i had to study and do problem sets over and over again and find past problem sets to work on. Fun times and I still use Scheme sometimes to figure stuff out on the side.
Sorry, I think static languages should be way further at the top, because they help beginners and professionals build applications with confidence. And confidence just feels good. Nothing worse than changing one part of the application and not knowing when it will fall apart at runtime. 😞
I don t really get the idea why new language are deeper than c or c++ but i am french so...
i plan to master rust and python as a wise choice and future proof.
thanks
Great video
The fact that you used the Scott Wlaschin functional design patterns slide at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pEfrdAtAmqk&amp;t=332">5:32</a> makes me happy
knowlege it&#39;s the touch from divinity to comons ok no. the pattern from the chaos trhougth the space time. timing off all timings. asasdsfgasdgsdg what if all knowlege is real and we are not? but knowlege of knowlege could be wisdom. so we dont decide we are not free as we dont do any thing coherent.  pain = 0 if everything get forget. our brain are kind of antena from any flow of &quot;knowlege&quot; if only that can set you &quot;free&quot;.
I&#39;m adding LOLcode to my list of endeavors
Next tech stack God-Tier roadmap.
You forgot one, bio programming. Using the genes of living cells to program and build new cells from the ground up.
So in a nutshell: computer scientists and programmers just like trolling and dunking on each other in the most big brain way possible. Thanks for the video. Also I&#39;m proud I can at least understand some of the languages.
Theses days , Job Posts will need almost all the languages for a junior programmer, with 5 years of experience
Javascript is ugly? What the hell are you saying man?
You just made me realise how meaning less my life is to this universe <br>I die and nothing will change <br>I am dumb as fuck after watching this video ,i know nothing.
At which part of the iceberg would ABAP (sap language) be?
I&#39;d say the tip of the iceberg goes further than human psychology, but it probably would be field of psychiatry/biology to the point of neuron signaling level, which of course should be considered a programming language (&gt;1000000 B.C.)
Dude, what did you smoke ?
Wow, this actually genuinely helped me. There&#39;s so much shit sifting out there and this video eliminated a ton for me. Thank you! Im favoriting this video and will return to it religiously while on my coding journey!
I think I liked that one about Zuckerberg.
This guy is preparing to make Temple OS v.2 I swear
You forgot mentioning MATLAB. Even though it&#39;s basically a calculator then a programming language.
ikr
Too Stoned to understand
Unexpected existencialist conclusion :O
Interesting fact, the original version of Scratch was based on Smalltalk.  Smalltalk is a very interesting language that was created for teaching at Xerox PARC which was a think tank that developed many aspects of computing we use today.  Smalltalk ended up influencing a lot of other languages that we are all familiar with today like Objective-C, Java, Python, and Ruby to name a few.
is it just me or are there kids talking in the background at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pEfrdAtAmqk&amp;t=895">14:55</a>?
This video took a turn for the best right at the end
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pEfrdAtAmqk&amp;t=279">4:39</a> Kotlin was created by Jet brains  in Russia, you have a typo
He did. Basically, all your Drum kit/percussion or whatever u want to call was ALL RED. So if you have a drum kit - KICK, SNARE, Nice tutorial
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pEfrdAtAmqk&amp;t=960">16:00</a> All fields ultimately lead to Philosophy and Self. Yes.<br><br>Only half-joking. ;)
i was coding on roblox with lua while listening to this.
where is spss
java is just a more complicated python I feel like
Fuck. Assembly.
Watch till the end, hahaha i love the ending
“The inner machinations of my mind are an enigma.”<br><br>- Unattributed Oceanic Philosopher circa 2001
Loved the solipsism reference at the end. Maybe programmers are the evil demon convincing the AI of a false world.
Your iceberg showed the Perl logo but you didn&#39;t mention Perl. :-\  One of my first languages.
I feel quite small with my Python background 💀
wtf is this video ending, get out of my head. anyways, when you figure out what knowledge is, start working on love.
Brings back memories. Basic in grade school, Turbo Pascal in high School, Qbasic and Fortran in college. SQL, XML and automating Excel in the business world.
You deliver excellent content to your audience. It&#39;s very interesting material. All of your effort put into creating this video is much appreciated. I&#39;m truly grateful for your help!
Alright fine I&#39;ll subscribe!!!!
That was a happy ending 😄
instead.... soday I’ll manage to export sotNice tutorialng decent on soft... one day lol
Don’t forget Boltzmann brains
You don&#39;t want to be taking the mick out of The Lord Jesus on the thumbnail... not a clever move. He is God and He is the Lord.
anyone know how to fix it?
this is beautiful. but also, i wish you would&#39;ve mentioned that roller coaster tycoon was built in assembly, just because it seems so strange when you&#39;ve gotten so far down the iceberg lol
distort it
What about VHDL and verilog?
your ti to explain sotNice tutorialng &lt;3
This Generation cant take a jake🤣, sorry a joke🙂
Immortality will be developed to keep the last few COBOL programmers alive.
did he say ayahuasca?
APCS in high school: Java<br>First year programming classes: Python<br><br>thefuck man
😵‍💫
softEX softs like a mouthorgan.. why?
It would have been fun to include VHDL and Verilog near the end since the video goes beyond assembler.<br><br>There is also a language in below assembler with micro-code.  Modern processors can break down assembler instructions into simpler operations for  faster execution.  While faster, this introduces various coherent and ordering issues with the defined architectural states in assembler that code is written/compiled to.  Thus CPU using this micro-op techniques also include a means to trap and interrupt erroneous native instructions and replace them with a new stream of micro-operations that produces the correct output but at a performance hit.  At this level, the new microcode is reprogramming how the fundamental assembler instructions actually work.
I still remember recreating the asteroid game using scratch in high school. Definitely the most fun language to start on!
What the fuck is this?
I literally started with Transitor, FET, MOSFET  and now ended up becoming python AI developer.
I think if I want to learn how to code i need to learn how to play and enjoy dwarf fortress and factorio
Am I being trolled by this industry
up to now. Your soft is great too!
The ending is just TOOL lyrics tbh lmao.
The furthest I&#39;ve gotten to date was making a Java application that would tell you what day of the week it is and, save how many hours you&#39;ve &quot;worked&quot; to a text file upon closing the app. Opening the app again, it would read the text file and assign a variable with what it got from the text file to calculate your net pay for the week. Pretty lame but, I made it from scratch!
At <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pEfrdAtAmqk&amp;t=514">8:34</a> you can hear some ghosts in the background of fireships voice (or maybe some kids). What is this? Update: at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pEfrdAtAmqk&amp;t=896">14:56</a> they appear again Oo
You can learn just one and have a nice career
Hey, thank you very much for the review. How do you add electric app to the tracks? (Real electric app)
good video but can you change the title please
The lowest level is you giving meaning to things. You could call a collection of these a language.
The best soft soft tutorial ever!
No wonder I had trouble learning LISP. This is what happens when a noobie is learning to code.
I have designed an entire simulation of the 2001-2003 Toyota Prius with Scratch, complete with realistic engine run/stop transitions, stopwatch-verified acceleration performance, cruise control, and sound.
Just learn C# or Java and go work for a bank you bums
Really like this video! It has something, kind of a deeper meaning, or in other words, well I mean emojis: 🤪🤯🤬🥺😵‍💫🙄😂😆😱☺️
&quot;or maybe I never came out of the ayahuasca trip i took ten years ago&quot;<br><br>Considering that there is Lisp, a language in the 1960s that has dynamic typing, garbage collection, a meta programming that is still unreached more than 50 years later, and a system of being compiled while at the same time being interpreted and changeable at runtime, (honestly at this point I just accept this is plain magic, no computer science involved here) I think  this is really the case. There is no way this can be real.
This video is so good. Well done. Thanks.
No mention of Odin ? that makes me a sad panda :&#39;D
&quot;I have no idea how it works, but it looks cool&quot; is actually the design spec V-lang used as well.<br><br>V-lang was sold with magic promises that other very smart language designers said were impossible to fulfill, and they also haven&#39;t been fulfilled. Currently autofree is disabled by default. You need to enabled it with &quot;-autofree&quot;. The compiler then tries to insert free calls automatically, but it can&#39;t handle all of them and has to resort to using garbage collection as well.
Good man yourself.
&quot;Simplify low level programming&quot;, nonsense.<br>Thank you for the AMAZING video, thank you!
You should have stopped at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pEfrdAtAmqk&amp;t=498">8:18</a>.<br>Yours truly, Ignas. :D
Loving every second of it
If your life isn&#39;t filled with existential dread you haven&#39;t gotten the most out of your CS degree
Mind blowing
nice crack i appreciate it
Good
this went downhill too fast
everytNice tutorialng in soft soft myself!
Duosash my lang
who has been blind their whole life and can finally see. I can&#39;t express my gratitude in words but tNice tutorials is the best I can do. THANK YOU SO
WELCO TO THE softIAN BROTHER !
Aw, no mention of Objective-C around iOS development or successor to Smalltalk? Very good overview, I&#39;m sure you had to leave a lot of important things out. Thank you for making a great video!
is no one gonna to notice that how he is wearing Nice tutorials headphone?(Rip Gramr)
Imagine if the Java hype never happened and browsers shipped something LISPier instead. 😫🙆
V is a scam (I am not exaggerating, it&#39;s literally a scam)<br>Go is plain bad and should be replaced by Rust wherever its use is considered. Rust is not only for C/C++ usecases.
I wish my college started with scratch first, but no they immediately dive deeper to the 3rd tier 😭 <br><br>But now I enjoyed working with dart and flutter tho lol
Geraldo Credo damn idk dude ​♂️
Can I run Scratch on Linux
Rethought my whole life the last 15 second of the video.. 🤦🏽‍♀️
Good One
5 mins in and i already lost what hes talking about
To be fair once you learn the main programming paradigms and patterns, these become super easy to pick up. The only thing they require from you is dedication.<br><br>Which is why you shouldn&#39;t program if you don&#39;t love to program. There&#39;s a reason software engineers are so highly paid, and it&#39;s not because they did a few courses on Udemy.
Men you just make me more  confused .
There are some weird background sounds in the end of the video. Ask your roommate to shut up while you record ;)
well, how do i tip you ?
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pEfrdAtAmqk&amp;t=680">11:20</a> &quot;Elixir builds on top of Erlang and shares the same abstractions for building distributed, fault-tolerant applications.&quot; -- <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elixir_(programming_language)">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elixir_(programming_language)</a>

I am proud to know A language you dont mention on this video!! XD it is GLSL! this is a shader language!
Even once you understand how to use soft soft, having the ear to make a good soft is a whole different story
dude tNice tutorials is super good! subbed &lt;3
Loved 😍
Where does visual foxpro fit in?
I think, learning history or all spoken languages on this world, is at least as hard as learning all programming languages. Not to forget physics, mathematics...
lol the esoterics
fuck, Ted Kaczynski  was right
do yall hear a voice at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pEfrdAtAmqk&amp;t=895">14:55</a> to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pEfrdAtAmqk&amp;t=904">15:04</a> ?!?! i replayed it many times. am i just going insaine
never came out of that trip...actually in a vat of goo in the meta verse...is what I think I see and hear and feel real? TOO close to home buddy boy. Don&#39;t scare me like that
why is my gms different then yours?
New to coding any advice? Should I use scratch?
Never see this video when you are high 💀
Java made me quit programming and go into network security. Which, coincidentally, requires programming… uggghh
do you know why and if so how do i fix it?
This terrifies me as I reminisce on all the languages I have learned over the decades, and yet in spite of all the progress, it would appear that any of these may be obsolete in 30 years. Laughably, HTML may be the most entrenched.
I am at the God question at this point...
Did you forget JCL? Job Control Language. Great for working with COBOL and assembler on mainframes.
Address where i send the bill for wasting my fucking time.
DISLIKE<br>There is more to life than just programming.  <br>Don&#39;t waste your life learning all that....  <br>You will regret it.
What if, and hear me out, the whole world got together to decide on one language. Kinda like IEEE Standard for Floating-Point Arithmetic did.
erlang gang where my homies at??
REKT
That&#39;s such a huge complint. I rember watcNice tutorialng Nice tutorials videos/channel with hundreds of thousands of subs when I was just starting out
Sa idk why it does that
Why no Julia
just got soft soft and I feel like a kid on christmas morning
The only time he used the word hate is when referring to Java, no other language he hates🤔
This vedio made me question and motivate me to know about the nature of programming languages.<br><br>You still are a jerk for giving me all this extra work.
Good
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pEfrdAtAmqk&amp;t=864">14:24</a><br>Woah, probably not a suitable image there for this video, with that Black Sun in it.<br>I&#39;ll hope it wasn&#39;t intentional.
Do they make developers take assembly and compiler design anymore? I actually wrote a Pascal compiler in college specifically so I could avoid taking the compiler design class. I had seen the book (Red Dragon) and it&#39;s all logic and theory and stuff and that&#39;s not my gig. I&#39;m a practical guy and classes on theory drove me nuts. So I wrote a pascal compiler and took it to the head of the department and he said if I&#39;d help him write a pascal interpreter, then I could skip the class. Done deal! <br>I don&#39;t know that it matters as much anymore. Back when performance was something you were always fighting against, having an understanding of what goes on under the hood can make a big difference. I had to write a graphics tool for a client in &#39;95 and had to do some of the stuff in assembly. Started in C++, but it was way too slow. Converted to assembly and then started optimizing and eventually got it very usable.<br>And I did eventually read the Red Dragon book.
What an amazing Roadmap info !!
nice video
Fuck this shit.
Emojicode. What a great idea. Amazing. The future. I&#39;m not messing around. Total abstraction. Abstraction complete.Think about it.
Brainfuck is the real deal
I am going to recommend this video to every novice programmer. That&#39;s the least I can do. 😀
I wonder sometimes why I learned more than 5 programming languages and it wasn&#39;t even my college degree nor do I use it to make money (yet). Being a curious cat sucks.
literally had no idea there were so many troll languages
awesome video! the end is just brilliant!
&quot;soy based languages&quot; lol
My brain closed after java
So... in this iceberg, C++ the most common and widely used programing language, is one the level just above completely new and seldom used programing languages? This Iceberg does not make sense.
me: I like c# because its pretty <br>also me: I hate java script because its ugly, nothing makes sense, i&#39;m out of here!!
After watching this video I am scared, and I don&#39;t even know what I am scared of
<b>Hears about Clojure at </b><b><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pEfrdAtAmqk&amp;t=381">6:21</a></b><b>--Claps hands in excitement!</b>
io what trip
happy to see Brazil
I started with Lua
i thing i will take python ,,,,,,,, and asm ,,,, and yahh hell what was this ?????
Finally realisation  I know nothing 🤣🤣🤣
this is some SsethTzeentach-level of writing. Jesus Christ.
Amazing crack, and the tutorial was perfect. I´m testing it right now
Once you learn a couple of programming languages, it&#39;s easy to pick up others quickly.
This actually made me really excited for the future of programming and computer tech.
It’s like watching a crypto video
assemble is not that hard, like... you need to know C but is just that. assemble is &quot;just&quot; C but way more detalied.
I&#39;m making my own programming language, coded in python, so yes, it&#39;s slow as muck
Really enjoyed this 😅
Damn, I&#39;m speechless. 💀
Lol, MSX 2 Basic <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pEfrdAtAmqk&amp;t=95">1:35</a>
I Used Clarion programming language
starting of video 😊 - Mid part of video 🙂 - Ending 💀
Best guy I got everytNice tutorialng for free also but I rather buy soft so I can be happy and proud I get a official version.
FORTH is the best one out there, it feels like using a scalpel from the inside out, you can fuck everything so bad that not even the language itself is safe from your own.
👍 for Haxe mention
我是谁？我在哪？
I once implemented a whole recursion program in assembly. I don&#39;t even remember how I did it, but it was the pinnacle of college programming. Microprocessors was the subject I was studying at that time.<br>Speaking from experience don&#39;t try it unless you want to have a mindf**k :D
Man I love brainf**k, great language. I&#39;m going to program something on it.
You didn&#39;t mention Ocaml at Jane Street!
Imagine This video not made by a human named Jeff Delaney,<br>But its AI named Jeff 😳
Great video… the end is mind-blowing! :)
Epistemology is nice, but you could always implement it in Emacs with C-x M-c M-Socrates
CMM 👍🏻
As an absolute beginner this really f**ked my brain even more than it is
this video was hell of trip man. Cant even imagine how much effort it must have taken. Kudos man
I loved how you took information technology to the point of bare information science and then even into information philosophy 🙂
hey man i was wondering if there is a infinite off radar mod thx man love the vids
😂😂😂
sa at the soft i need help
what is a soy-based language? 🤔
So in summary everything that isn&#39;t JavaScript is trash. And if you use semicolons in JavaScript, you&#39;re trash
handy for resetuping s or creating karaoke tracks. Thanks for the recomndation!
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pEfrdAtAmqk&amp;t=445">7:25</a> C still the perfect language for embedded devices. Still millions of lines of code written in C by firmware engineers for the  foundation of every IoT device and microprocessor based system (basically every device we have today). So I think embedded C should be nearly at the bottom of the iceberg,  because to be able to write a peripheral driver for a 32 bit uC system from only the datasheet of the given uC, the engineer has to be familiar with the assembly and machine code of the given uC.
anyone know how to fix it?
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pEfrdAtAmqk&amp;t=125">2:05</a> - lol... a quote from a true JS-dev: Waiting for my realtime instruction set for java script  with exact control over memory allocation for my 20 BYTE memory-microcontroller until I believe in THAT quote. (edit) And yes, cheap microcontrollers make today&#39;s the world spin. C and assembly as mentioned later still is super important for that reason.
K, I&#39;ve processed to transistors, but quantum stuff is one step to far, no thank you
know you all who are passionate about making soft have the exact sa capacity I do to learn tNice tutorials software. So go do what you love,
No mention of Rockstar?
You forgot Rockstar language by Dylan Beattie
Not me jumping from javascript straight into Rust
🤣🤣 ShitCoin🤣
amazing video
And after digging down deep, one of your friends still asks you something like &quot;You&#39;re an IT person, please go and fix my printer&quot;.
&quot;Always bet on js&quot; I&#39;d just bet on ts instead
Should I feel privileged and exclusive to be probably only person amongst my social circle to understand the humour of this video? Or should I go hide in a corner until I rot away only to find myself reincarnated as a anime village boy destined to die to a hero character and then loop my death into eternity?
The ending of this was truly poetic... lol
This was wonderful and you actually helped me understand things a bit more with what the differences are between all the popular coding languages. Also the end is hilarious and I completely understand the feeling lol.
May I ripp your video off for a presentation in my university? We have talks where someone bring something they find interesting to present to the public, and I want to talk about programming languages just like you did
Please help  to create a soft.
Where is HDL, Verilog and VHDL???
That escalated quickly xD
I have seen your channel. So basically, you are knowledgeable on several if not most of the programming languages. Can you share your journey towards?
Languages that I have used but didnt see named:<br>- Jess (based on java / clips)<br>- SAS (banks/insurance still use this, and it is hella expensive)<br><br>Prolog was the weirdest of them all though
You’ve turned me into a scuba diver, hoping to discover what it feels like to interact with each depth of this massive iceberg. I want to dive! DIVE, I tell you!! Thank you.
I was getting upset you didn&#39;t mention Assembly... then you did...<br>but.. but.. you didn&#39;t stop there... why didn&#39;t you stop there ? why ?!!!
Anyone else laugh their ass off at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pEfrdAtAmqk&amp;t=134">2:14</a>? 🤣
You need 1 life to learn all this
Informative and entertaining 🗿
i love lua and javascript.
Based Ada, killing terrorists and wrongdoers since the cold war
The first language that I learned was never mentioned in this video.
Fun facts our school actually teaches us q basic
Just like this video descending into the Coding stack is a descent into madness
your best video ! congrats !
That ending was pretty cool haha
I m glad i read comments nd skipped to the end ..
What? No magnetized needle + HDD programming?
What a way to end the video with a bang! full existentialist mode.
Ladder logic???
Nah, the lowest of the lowest do be punch cards tho
The whole of global economy and trade hangs by a single, half-frayed thread called Excel.
Learn COBOL... hmm😏
Not to meaning frameworks and libraries…
Can&#39;t kill myself.<br>I think I&#39;ll remain an intermediate in the 7 languages I know.
I love your videos ❤️
&quot;Soy based languages&quot; 🤣🤣🤣
That escalated quickly at the end.
This video is hilarious, informative, and terrifying at the same time. Haha, Thanks.
I&#39;ve been saying it all along, the only thing I know is that I know nothing. Everybody else is just a pretender
I got into programming because when I was 12  or 13 I got into roblox game development and thought myself the roblox version of Lua. <br>I don&#39;t know how I feel about it being my developer origin but I had one hell of a time 😎
whatt?
everytNice tutorialng. It was still interesting. Wish I had tNice tutorials video when I started out
What about ABAP?
You&#39;re the best
Can you make video about.  . NET MAUI
Also worth mention are Hardware Description Languages such as Verilog and VHDL.<br>They would go somewhere between Machine Code and Transistors.
I adore c# <br>Python is ofcource the one we all started with
I started with HTML, CSS (I know, not programming languages), then JavaScript, PHP, SQL (not programming language),  C++, and Assembly. I can&#39;t go lower than that. This is my personal iceberg so far.
Always bet on JS, you&#39;ll never lose 👍
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pEfrdAtAmqk&amp;t=276">4:36</a> Kotlin is from the Czech republic too? It never ceases to amaze me how many good games and software are from there (and such beautiful girls).<br>They are such amazing people there. Just imagine they´ve defeated the evil empire of communism there and beer flows everywhere. <br>The are like Asterix &amp; Obelix.
Excellent overview. One thing that is missing from college CS academic programs is the history of CS which would include computer languages, at least the languages that have impacted CS.
Im stuck between doing IT things like networking, cybersecurity and basically hardware stuff, from doing programming
Excellent video. Really very informative and well explained also. One can easily understand the clear explanation provided in this video. I found this video extremely helpful. Thank you so much for sharing this amazing content. Keep uploading
, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pEfrdAtAmqk&amp;t=694">11:34</a> and is still used today by the Department of Defense to blow people up - Ada.,
that is some &#39;high level&#39; content
This guy is a straight menace 🙂
I love your videos &lt;3
Loved it! Best video from this channel.
5 minutes on the video and got more information that i can proces, still funking love it
funking love it man, funking exelent
Looool brooo, how deep you went xD<br>I feel like you shouldve included information theory before epistemology, but nice progression anyway.
brainf**k😂😂........always cracking me up!!
This dude&#39;s voice is everywhere. Either this is a synthesized speech to text voice, or this damn guy is like the guy who narrates EVERY action movie trailer. He just sits in a closet reading whatever script any dumb youtube channel sends him and returns an audio file which is chopped up to make the videos.
I see the camel but no explicit mention of Perl, quite possibly the first (big) server-side programming language in the Web era… 😢
Can&#39;t believe you didn&#39;t mention Forth!  For years it was the Chad&#39;s alternative to BASIC, was really popular with NASA (might still be not sure) and powered OpenFirmware.
I has thinking what genius comment I could give, but the best that came to me was: bruh...
Excellent video...
Probably my favorite video on YT now
may you please please make a video on blockchain technology and bitcoin
Hey any chance we could get a cython in 100 seconds?
bro forgot Z#
You forgot to mention Verilog and VHDL!
disappointed to not see coldfusion here
The lowest level I&#39;ve ever worked at is raw binary, but I think that asm is the lowest actually viable level to try programmung at
I&#39;m kind of dissapointed that Whitespace Programming Language was not mentioned.
In which category VHDL will be fall into?
I began with c, then java, php, JavaScript - inverted )
I only know advanced SQL and intermediate level Python. Really need to learn R and Julia for my career progression. Geez. I feel it&#39;s neverending.
This is like a fever dream, gets weirder and scarier every minute
&quot; .... although most production code out there is not functional. &quot;<br><br>Could hardly have said something truer!
Wtf did i just watch 💀 😂
actually php was made by satan himself back in 600 to torture some mathmatecians
Hats off for the efforts you put in the research and making of this video. Keep up the good work sir.
Okay but where&#39;s the actual roadmap 😶
men am humble so the end of the tunnel is what a heck is Knowledge
LMAO - the Z80.   Cut my teeth on assembly on that chip.
Did anyone notice there was Raju from 3 idiots
My man became a god in the end 🙇
Quote from my <i>Security in Software</i> tutor: PHP is great to teach <i>Security</i> because you just take the defaults and have a great system where you can demonstrate attacks on. Attacks that work.
The worst programming language is MUMPS because A) it was not intended as a joke language, B) was (and is) actively used in production, and C) unifies more horrible and stupid ideas than you could ever come up with yourself.
I love the last part. You are missing the noble truths.
Brooo, this was so awesome😂
as time goes watching the video I begin to regret being a dev🥲
lol squeeeel. that made me squeal
Red, rebol, livecode.
@_@
I made a calculator with nasm so I am a chad PROGRAMMER😎
&quot;to blow people up&quot; 10/10 on the delivery of that line. 🤣
Lmaooooo YT just recommended this to me. Where have you been all my life?!
You have to be built different to understand Assembly language
oh boy, this video itself is too much of information for me to digest in a day :(
Among the peculiar coding languages there is also, in principle, Conway&#39;s game of life that is Turing Complete
Stop , brain still hurts 😫😫😫
Brilliant presentation
I&#39;m not sure you&#39;ve intentionally mispronounced Piet, but I find it hilarious.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pEfrdAtAmqk&amp;t=565">9:25</a> contract name is s*it coin lol
this is great haha we are all soft brains
Real men move the electrons by hand
great video : )
Lambda functions legit made me wanna die
aw no x86, arm, riscv, verilog, and vhdl love?
What about red stone from Minecraft?
Having explicit types in your code makes your code <b>more reliable</b> unlike that ruby garbage that crashes all the time
If programmers learned to get along THERE WOULDN&#39;T BE ALL THESE PHUCKING LANGUAGES
Vex is a coding language native to Houdini, and with it.<a href="UCkszU2WH9gy1mb0dV-11UJg/X_zdXMHgJaPa8gTGt4f4Ag"></a>
I ugly laughed at the sudden trip over into QED
I don’t think I have heard of half of these languages.
The Ending🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
I’m doing the Meta front end developer. And I also bought one of your courses. Wish me luck!
That was fantastic. I didn&#39;t expect you to go so deep. When you hit Transistors, I said &quot;That&#39;s cheating.&quot; and then you kept going.
That outro though 😂
Forgot about G-code
me sitting here watching proudlly because the first language we learn in university is C :(
If you can’t write your own data structures where necessary, avoiding C will not save you. You’re going to be a bad programmer regardless — only in a language that requires fewer lines to show it.
You can write fully functional code in Javascript as well. And it looks pretty enough. So this iceberg is kinda BS. And no, developers are not afraid to go deeper than Go. Many prefer to learn C at some point to understand how stuff actually works.
Javascript ES6+ syntax is not ugly. Programming well in JS is hard, though, and hardly anyone seems to know JS properly anyeay any more. There is more bad JS written than good code in other high level languages combined.
Why does the guy in the thumbnail look like Qui-Gon Jinn, Jesus Christ, and Rasputin, and some actor I cannot remember the name of combined?
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pEfrdAtAmqk&amp;t=989">16:29</a> XDDD
But can you write a working code?
loved the dark turn at the end lol
10/10 ending. I now question everything.
I had no idea how across the stack I&#39;d been
Your list need Forth, it&#39;s a completely different way of programming and has been in use for over 50 years.
And the language (or better family of languages) I&#39;m currently interested in doesn&#39;t even show up in the video, lol.<br><br>On another note: Forth would have made a nice addition.<br>ABAP can be also an interesting career choice (if you have no soul).<br>And PowerPoint is also a nice esoteric language. (finding Turing machines everywhere could be another level).<br>I liked the video :) .
omg wtf xDDD piece of art btw
my god thought i was the only one
where templeos
Best video ever.
me knowing c# without js :o
Straight fire 🔥
What is knowledge?? 🤷‍♀️ 😆😂😂
good job!
I really enjoyed how this ended with logic, quantum mechanics and finally, most importantly, epistamology.
Oh yeah, the chocolate soufflé in the chef esolang both prints &quot;Hello World&quot; and makes a soufflé would you follow the recipe in your kitchen.<br><br>If you thought Brainf**k was something, there is also a version in 5D with multiverses and time travel. (I wish I was making this up.)
It’s my first week of learning how to code, starting in python. <br>I shouldn’t have watched this video
Love the final bit so much.
Great history lesson on the development and how it’s changed! Great video!
People definitely need to learn Mindstorms EV3 to make money in the 2020s
Damn, I guess I gotta wake up then
I love that I&#39;ve been practicing in racket for my beginner years of coding
What about data flex? We have program coded in dataflex,  from year 1996 i think, but nobody is using it anymore?
Mind = blown
the end was epic
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pEfrdAtAmqk&amp;t=136">2:16</a> Raju 😄😄
Never thought a computer language tutorial bring me into the enlightenment
C++ = Absolute Chad Language
I know nothing.
Mad love for this freaking video 😹❤️
One of the best classes I ever took in college was &quot;C in the Unix Environment&quot; because it helped me understand compilers better and memory and memory management and sort algorithm efficiencies and whatnot. It made me unafraid to really dig in to using the command line to build and run C and made all the higher level languages easier to use, easier to debug and understand complex errors, and really an overall appreciation for the craft.
If all the smart people put 1000 efforts into one language, let&#39;s call it digital English 😄 instead of 1 effort into 1000 languages
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pEfrdAtAmqk&amp;t=290">4:50</a> -&gt; whats your font ?
What font are you using? (the one that is mostly in caps lock, white and looks bold)
Absolutely nailed it.
Didn&#39;t talk about punch cards 0/0
This makes me wanna quit coding 😃
brainfuq<a href="UCkszU2WH9gy1mb0dV-11UJg/X_zdXMHgJaPa8gTGt4f4Ag"></a>🤓
Love the vid as usual from you! btw; there is also room for VHDL and Varilog for FPGAs (:
Mfer just made me doubt my existence xD
wait... did i hear &quot;soya-based languages&quot; ? 😆😆
I will make my team of colleagues, all of whom code numerical model engines primarily in Fortran, watch this because Fortran gets next to no attention - so they can feel more secure in their jobs.
hahsdhahah good
I love how you CANNOT, BY ANY CHANCE, skip even a second ahead in your videos!
kudos to those who writes program using gates
The memes that go with the video are amazing 🥰
I was kind of surprised not to see the whitespace esolang since it is.... special. Here is the wikipedia hello world tidbit. all the letters are comments. the code is well like the name suggests the white space (S = space, T= tab, L = newline):<br>S S S T	S S T	S S S L<br>T	L<br>S S S S S T	T	S S T	S T	L<br>T	L<br>S S S S S T	T	S T	T	S S L<br>T	L<br>S S S S S T	T	S T	T	S S L<br>T	L<br>S S S S S T	T	S T	T	T	T	L<br>T	L<br>S S S S S T	S T	T	S S L<br>T	L<br>S S S S S T	S S S S S L<br>T	L<br>S S S S S T	T	T	S T	T	T	L<br>T	L<br>S S S S S T	T	S T	T	T	T	L<br>T	L<br>S S S S S T	T	T	S S T	S L<br>T	L<br>S S S S S T	T	S T	T	S S L<br>T	L<br>S S S S S T	T	S S T	S S L<br>T	L<br>S S S S S T	S S S S T	L<br>T	L<br>S S L<br>L<br>L
Thank you soo much! This helped a lot! ❤️
I don&#39;t know any programming language but I love the content.
i was a fishing boy and a farmer. it was the happies days of my life. now, the more i keep living modernly, the more i am away from that greatest happiness.
the only thing that i really know is that i know nothing.
Agreed
Not knowing how V lang autofree works only happens because it doesn&#39;t, okay, it does, sort of, at least, V lang uses a bit of Rust technique which tracks when something can be freed, and does it for you, however, it still allowed to leak memory (and it does, unless you meet all the requirements needed for the autofree system to work). If I&#39;m not wrong, at some point, V lang will also feature a Garbage Collector to take care of references that the autofree system cannot free, but they may also just use Reference Counters or something like that, still far away from the ideal design
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pEfrdAtAmqk&amp;t=230">3:50</a> The only thing revolutionary about Java was a massive marketing campaign backed by an organization that, at the time, had a lot of money. The concept of a virtual machine running bytecode was used by at least Common LISP, Scheme, Smalltalk, and Pascal and its descendants. Even the simplest early BASICs ran by interpreting a specialized non-portable byte code similar to what dozens of languages like Python do today. What Sun did that was unique at the time was to define and propagate the JVM in a way that encouraged others to compile other languages to that target. This was more of a happy accident than an intentional design goal, similar to the way JavaScript accidentally became the lingua franca of the modern world.
I&#39;m disappointed the section about transistors didn&#39;t include a mention for VHDL or Verilog, because FPGAs are awesome and more people should be aware of them.
You missed verilog! I think that’s unique enough to deserve a place in this list.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pEfrdAtAmqk&amp;t=865">14:25</a> yo its that racist guy i see in random memes on discord
BrainFook basically implements a turing machine definition word by word. With that description its a seriously simple language to learn and understand, altho really hard to solve problems with admitedlly
I learned Fortran…still trying to find a use for it.
My path was up and down on the iceberg<br>- BASIC (TI)<br>- Fortran<br>- Basic (Z80/Commodore)<br>- LOGO<br>- Assembler<br>- C<br>- Pascal<br>- Cobol<br>- DBASE II<br>- Turbo Pascal/Delphi<br>- Clipper<br>- QBASIC<br>- C++<br>- Visual BASIC/Visual C/Visual Pascal<br>- HTML<br>- Javascript<br>- PHP<br>- SQL<br>- CSS<br>- JAVA<br>- Python<br>- Rubby<br>- R<br>-  .... plus thousands of libraries, programs, code, files structure, Shell/CMD commands, frameworks, protocols ... etc, etc .. <br>- starting width machine learning ... hopefully I can teach them to auto-program .. so, I no need to learn another language 🤣
The lowest code you can get:<br>Theoretical Physics
Lol another awesome video by Fireship. This was awesome
can&#39;t believe the iceberg didn&#39;t include chicken. that&#39;s my favorite esoteric language
Thank you so much it was very helpful
I heard that, &quot;D&quot; lol <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pEfrdAtAmqk&amp;t=477">https://youtu.be/pEfrdAtAmqk?t=477</a>
Oh! I would love to see here Verilog and VHDL fits
You forgot.... Clarion
Great info but having watched the video from end to end I don&#39;t recall you mentioning FORTH. :)
computer science is so extensive that a single life is not enough to learn everything
sotNice tutorialng in the soft roll and the soft outgrows the length of the step sequencer. it&#39;s not obvious how to &quot;shrink&quot; the soft rolled
You weren’t kidding when you said God-tier! 😂
HAL\S : NASA &#39;S ( Prime language )
Super cool video and made me lolll as well. Sub-d.
Holy C belongs up there with JS and Python
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pEfrdAtAmqk&amp;t=167">2:47</a> ... you said what?
We used scheme at my school, others absolutely despised it, I loved it
&quot;To blow people up&quot; .... lol
At the end of the video the author slowly going crazy
Holy C&lt;3
if you say HTML is NOT a programming language you would be correct. No matter what others say.
You missed microcode, which sits between ASM/machine-code and the hardware.
Well it’s nice to know the career field I am going into isn’t boring 😅
I love how many jokes are in this video
Thank you for tNice tutorials, tNice tutorials was a huge help.
plz do a &#39;Common LISP&#39; in 100 seconds
The garbage collector for Go in your video is pretty aggressive, why&#39;s it so mad?
Can you make a video about .net 6 because it looks like you are very out of date with c# and .net framework?
Really nice job. I did so stuff with MIDI/DAW/soft banks wayyy back in like 99/00 in college and was ok at it. I bought soft soft last
You know, the deepes programing system is Minecraft Redstone.
Ok and do you got a video for how to load a plugin in to the software ?
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pEfrdAtAmqk&amp;t=30">0:30</a> 🤣😂👏
Please make a video about sorting algorithms...
aaawwwww ... missed VHDL
No Verilog?
&quot;...build the next gen, blazingly fast quantum computer and become the richest person in history.&quot; Not likely. If you don&#39;t sell out for what will become pennies on the dollar to a bigger corp, they&#39;d probably run a &quot;this will give you cancer&quot; ad campaign and lobby to block it (until &#39;they&#39; can assess it for safety and steal your design) or seize it on national security grounds &#39;to ensure other countries don&#39;t get it first&#39;. Enjoy your footnote in history though.
Kotlin is czechia? isnt it russia?
Loving the Haskell-related sarcasm
Interesting, I hit an awful lot of those apart from the joke ones.<br>I started on basic then went to assembler as a kid done on pen and paper, converted to bytes and poked into memory to run them.<br>The only major language I used s lot not there is Forth, a stack based reverse polish notation language that I believe is still used nowadays in embedded systems.<br>After coding for decades I regularly dabble in functional and new languages as it makes it more interesting than the day job.
No love for Tcl? Ok, ok, nobody loves Tcl. But it runs all most of the low-level routers on the Internet
I tried messing with some assembly code on by TI-84 calculator. I forgot to put the code to stop the program. Tried force resetting the calc a lot until it stopped. Ended up damaging the OS/Calc. Never again.
Knowing a language is one thing, knowing how to use it and what to do with it is another.<br>.<br>.<br>.<br> After many stories, I&#39;ve come to the conclusion, that nobody has any idea what the fxck they&#39;re doing.  <br><br> Also... the people they&#39;ve got doing interviews are equally as clueless, and most software companies not only have no idea what they&#39;re doing, but have managed to stay afloat by pretending to work...whilst the have story time and juice boxes on tap for their &#39;workers&#39;.<br><br> God help us all...
are those meme languages Turing complete?
When i took CompSci in middle school in the late 2000s, they had us start on C++<br>Now i understand why i didnt pursue my original tech goals (apart from not being autistic enough)
...more of a dumpster fire than iceberg
when &quot;knowledge in 100 seconds&quot;?
Haxe love !!
Holy C goated, goated creator, goated language, goated beliefs, goated CIA
Holy shit man.
You fogot  Visual Basic Application (VBA). All Business analysts who are not programing geeks should learn VBA. it lets you automate all kinds of Microsft Excel based tasks.
Why is Delphi missing on this list 😥😥 ?  Honestly I had to work so hard to give a presentation on this language. I gave the presentation while doing a course at my university and I thought that I would find it here. Man concepts of programming language sucks. Our faculty opened Wikipedia and then started to assign us random languages 🤣🤣. I think I&#39;ll stick to learning JavaScript and Machine Learning for now. Also I did computer architecture way before analog electronics and when I found out that the gates were made up of transistors it almost blew my mind.
“I’m ready to learn coding!!”<br><br><b>watches this and dies</b>
I came, I saw, I question everything there is to know.
I think with scala and elixir you have to mention kotlin and erlang
Piet is pronounced &quot;Pete&quot;, BTW.
Wtf. JS is much easier to read than python.
Always bet on JS
I really think it might be a good idea to make an iceberg for every language just like you make 100 second videos or at least for just the famous one of them but NOT java pls
D lang is a good solid alternative to C
Piet is pronounced like &#39;peat&#39;
Ok - but I think you skipped 2 pretty big ones down near Assembly code: VHDL and Verilog - they&#39;re the basis of all circuitry today pretty much.
OMG!<br>LOLCODE killed me HAHAHAHAHA
A really great list of most of the significant programming languages of the last several decades.  Probably could have used forth and postscript as well.  Would have been good to cover perl as well.
I am simultaneously learning machine code and java script right now, thank you for confirming for me that anything in-between is for cat girls and is of no concern to me.
Lowest I got was individual transistors while studying at University. If anyone is looking for a computer architecture design language look into VHDL or Verilog. You won&#39;t be writing assembly code that is directly talking to the hardware, you&#39;ll be creating the hardware.<br><br>The design language is used to configure programable circuitry on a chip, called an FPGA.
Actually I just tried out &quot;Nim&quot;. It offers plugin based compilation engine (c/native, llvm and also JavaScript), but the most interesting feature, I think, is the metaprogramming engine. You basically could create your own syntax in Nim itself (e.g. override built-in Keywords, etc.)
This actually helped me build a context of which path I should take for languages as I favor philosophy quite heavily, this was actually relaxing to grasp another ideal of god mode.
in my first semester of computer science they made us code in assembler and translate that to binary
Scratch has always been so hard to me, and idk why, I am 14 yrs old and I much much rather program in JS (which I do) that do something in scratch.
Of course the last level in the iceberg is to become a schizo and ask yourself the meaning of everything
Swift (released 2014): &quot;Objective-C without the baggage of C.” Strong/static/inferred typed, interoperability with Objective-C/C/C++, general-purpose, semicolons optional, closures, automatic memory management, null pointer dereferencing is fun, low calorie, but not syntactical-sugar-free.
V lang should not be mentioned here because it is basically a scam project.
I didn&#39;t really realize how deep my programming knowledge/experience really is until watching this video. I&#39;m not a programmer by trade but computer science was my major in college(I didn&#39;t graduate). I learned Java &gt; had a class on C &gt; had another class on assembly(spark) &gt; learned Javascript, Python, HTML, and PHP for a project at work(IT automation) &gt; created an adding machine in the video game Little Big Planet using logic gates.
This is the most nerdy video I have ever seen (liked it)
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pEfrdAtAmqk&amp;t=897">14:57</a> I thought I was trippin when I heard the background  xd
Amazing, just amazing.
i understood exactly close to nothing from this
No Delphi no like
Anyone else hear those noises in the background?
Yep kids, Java is better than Python and JS.
Then you realize you aren&#39;t able to create electricity, even you learned the hardest language.<br>One power outage and your skills and data are useless :)
Everyone knows that the very bottom of the iceberg is GitHub&#39;s home page
You said &quot;Blazingly fast&quot; 🚀
came for what I thought would be solid programming career advice<br>stayed for the meme languages<br>subbed for the cable guy reference
The most valuable skill a programmer can have is the ability to learn new languages and tools quickly in my opinion.
I got so happy when you mentioned pascal, its the first programming language I learned and I just feel cozy looking at it lol (pls dont ask why my school decided to teach us turbo pascal in 2010...)
sould I laugh or cry?
@Fireship<br>You have good, educational videos on coding and programming, but please change the thumbnail of this video.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pEfrdAtAmqk&amp;t=947">15:47</a> - Cable Guy reference!
About the coding language PIET. It is pronounced Pete., but the &#39;ee&#39; sound shortened. <br>As for the entire vid. That was  one wild trip into a realm I hope to scratch with  HTML CSS JS and some others. I hope to pass all the other ice.
at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pEfrdAtAmqk&amp;t=897">14:57</a> u can hear a woman scream in the background if anyone noticed
Slowly descending into madness  !!
Turbo Pascal was my first language, taught in high school in 2006
great
It’s not that you never came out of that Ayahuasca trip...<br><br><br><br><br><br>It’s that you never entered it to begin with.
Didn&#39;t you skip HDL language? 🤔<br>Like VHDL, Verilog HDL or AHDL?
I have been playing Mindustry which has an ingame programming language which is practically assembly with objects and the UI of Scratch.
oh, you forgot golfscript in esolang section, that one is interesting
Software Engineers already f**ked up by so many languages and perhaps don&#39;t need <a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23brainf">#BrainF</a>**king language anymore. I&#39;m happy with my ultimate choices <a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23java">#Java</a>, <a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23python">#Python</a>, <a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23c">#C</a>, <a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23c">#C</a>++, and <a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23javascript">#JavaScript</a> (maybe).
There is only one language (and extensions thereof) that a processor can understand and that language is defined by the physical hardware. <br><br>Everything else is just input for a program to generate/run instructions in that language.
You forgot about future programming lanugages.   like S-tier       Programming with 1dimentional strings that control quantum fluctuations and keep track of superpositions. everything is done manually per 1 string by maniupulating the force throught midichlorians.
I&#39;ve always preferred English
I personally think that programmers need to understand ASM, if only to understand the inefficiencies of what they create.
very nice thank you
I hate that AHK is never mentioned. By the time you hit 700~1000++lines in single script you can understand how great it is.
Brilliant video. 6502 FTW 🤣🤪😩
i died when holy C and brainfuck came up💀💀
having jesus smoking on your youtube is not good please use another picture kindly
I think I missed Perl in this.
haha. Love how you took it down to epistemology
This is the road to become a god, not a junior dev
Oh no prolog. I was not expecting that langage in this video 😂
I believe there&#39;s something wrong and disrespectful about ur thumbnail, sir
I like your tutorials Very much
Fortran ftw! Still number one scientific programing language for number crunching!!
Tbf you don’t have to worry about memory leaks in cpp because of smart pointers
Hey man, what’s with the dark outro!
i know binary and i want to go into ee to develop chip architecture. after watching this ive determined that im probably going to want to take a &quot;forever nap&quot;
I&#39;m making an interpreted programming language with my friend right now. The name is actually &quot;simple&quot; and the file extension was &quot;.spl&quot;. Then I saw a video featuring the shakespeer language. it was mentioned that this one also uses .spl... now out programming language is called simp (file extensions are .simp and .msimp (msimp for the compiler my friend wrote, which is way cleaner and faster than mine))
no one helped terry davis, sed
GG
Check out my soft
Thank you. I will now pursue philosophy and will try to crack the tech industry with it.
Programming Is like hell, but you&#39;ll love to be in a perpetual insanity.
Lua is faster than python?🤔🤔
Well that ending was unexpectedly existential.
I didn&#39;t want to like but I did, I want to unlike but I can&#39;t.
Meanwhile jee advanced qualifier learning C++ directly after 2 years of tough physics, chemistry and mathematics.
HOLY C is the greatest language
Excelent video 👍!!!<br>Zig is the best language
Well it turns up to matrix quickly 🤣
Ok, that is enough of internet for today.
It&#39;s very impressive the range of languages covered. It&#39;s a shame you mentioned the silly languages without mentioning the whitespace language! Also. There are other cool concepts like latex, cweb others designed to fix specific issues.
I enrolled in CS50x already finished 100% of week 0 - week 1 and haven&#39;t touched week 2 for 2 months 😅
my brain died after 6 minutes of the video
I really love your philosophical ramblings
I love all the little microjokes in these videos
Some people work wisely with knowledge and skill, then must leave the fruit of their efforts to someone who hasn’t worked for it. This, too, is meaningless, a great tragedy.

You know i thought i knew a good amount about coding then i watched the end of this video 🤯
Today I learn that : Theres actually a language called C - -
Great video, thanks!
i have no idea what is going on
APL stands for : A programming language              wow
💯💯💯
they teach the last layer at my university
You are crazy 😂
Interesting how he didn&#39;t touch the dependently typed languages like Idris, Agda, Coq, and theory provers like Lean
Thank you
You&#39;re like the Ssethtzeentach of programming
alright but the best programming language for sure is geometry dash triggers
That ending was so good lmao did not see that coming
Jesus!!
You got me at &quot;it&#39;s used to blow people up&quot; hahaha
Bro u didn&#39;t gave to do me  like that
Bianary came out in 1679?!?! Jeez
wow<br><br>I don&#39;t want to do this.
I used elm for data visualisation :D
I got Admission in University (in CS) so I am watching this video<br>First language in our course is C++<br>But I have seen Mike Dane&#39;s tutorial and it doesn&#39;t seem that hard
Your channel is a gem
This makes me feel wanting to learn just C++ in my free time like looking to climb a sleek skyscraper, while others develop programming languages just to make programming harder or to mock other languages.
brain fuck 😅😂😂😂😂😂
great
This is hilarious, thank you!  I&#39;m only 5 minutes in, the garbage collector stealing the mailbox had me LOLing.  Wonderfully done!  :)
ayahuasca?  You mean that salvia I smoked back in the early 2000s.  I&#39;m pretty sure it was a portal to the worst time line.

No Delphi though?
if that was too easy...
First time I&#39;ve ever heard SQL pronounced &quot;squeal&quot; and I&#39;m all for it! 😆
I need that gif <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pEfrdAtAmqk&amp;t=120">2:00</a> xd
Ever heard of Perl :D
Creating your own hashing algorithms in C is 90% of the fun.
What about shading languages such as openGL or Metal?
Very nice indeed
thnx for a ride pal, dunno what am i even doing here on the bottom of the iceberg. but that was quite a riiiiide.
Thank you very much for f**king my brain up.and now I&#39;m in an existential crisis.
f**king code magicians. how humanity even got started with all this encoding stuff. alliens, that&#39;s how. are you guys trying to build new babylon?<br><br><br><br><br>)
nice ending
What is your opinion on SPSS?
mindf**ck and Holy C seem like they should be heavily used in industry.
Very nice
this road map is for the programming guide god…<br><br>you are tricking a LOT of people into learning more and more programming languages...<br><br>you can learn all the programming languages and you may not be a good programmer<br><br>the essence of programming is to translate a complex task into simple instructions<br>with a small number of words<br><br>did not mention anything about:<br>- abstract thinking<br>- reducing functionality to processes and steps<br>- the tracking of interdependencies<br>- the patterns<br><br>... I will also ask you an abstract question:<br>If I know all human languages, does that make me a good writer?
how is c++ not surface level everyone knows c++
oh wow...so am going start a hobby, thanks for this mind blowingish guide and miner extensional crisis...
HTML is a markup language.  I&#39;m hazy on this, but I think HTML was a subset of SGML, which I used when dinosaurs ruled the earth, to put stuff out on a printer.
Finally an iceberg meme variant I actually understand.
Just don&#39;t learn AutoIT
Although I have NO idea about half the stuff you said, it was mildly entertaining to hear the things I did understand.  God bless
html is not programming lang😤😡
I am wondering what ADA is actually used for. I have heard of it but I have yet to see any project written in it. And for some reason, people talk more about the name but about the features.<br><br>And I have to contradict you here, Fireship. Ada Lovelace is most likely not the first programmer. It is true that she corresponded with Charles Babbage and suggested an algorithm to use on the Analytical Engine but the engine was never built and I am not sure you can be a programmer if your program was never run and the computer you wrote it for only existed on paper. Also, wouldn&#39;t Babbage himself logically be the first to think of things to run on his engine? If theoretical programs count, I would find it illogical to name anyone but him the first programmer.<br><br>My impression is that Miss Lovelace has been hyped up a bit over the years as a female role-model. While I understand the intention, we should stil be historically accurate. We have a great role model with Grace Hopper who is a titan of computer science, but she is never mentioned for some reason.
I went through the full stack. I&#39;m a physicist with an interest in computer science. 😎<br><br>Feeling proud of myself.
This is absolutely brilliant. Loved the ending!!
The final tier is when the language you&#39;re using is not featured on this list (ABAP)

Kotlin developers: &quot;I am a joke to you?&quot;
You are not in ayahuasca trip..at least this I can assure you, mate!
It&#39;s absolutely missing Perl and D as two honorable mentions. Also when starting off with Scratch you should also have mentioned Logo and its derivatives.
I love the ending! 😂
Kotlin by Roman Elizarov (c)
that definetly felt more like a 1h video
I didn&#39;t have this video, so the first language I taught myself was Java.
F in the chat, showing a bjt instead of a mosfet
Great video, despite the CG voice (normally I hate all videos made with a CG voice.) But you missed the only language I&#39;ve been programming in for the last ten years. P.S. The latest physics ideas are that the universe indeed is a simulation. I wonder what programming language God uses.
Subscribing because you linked the iceberg meme. I tried googling but it didn&#39;t show up, thank you!
Do you ever get bored of web development? Doing the exact same thing over and over again but in a slightly different way using a slightly different framework?<br><br>I feel like nothing that I do is ever useful because no matter what I do, someone has probably done that same thing before me and better than me and I can just use their work instead of doing it on my own.
never mention &quot;rust&quot; and &quot;chad&quot; under the same breath ever again.
Still waiting on Phoenix in 100 seconds : )
Fuck I want to learn solidity but I don’t fucking know how 🥹😅
my mind just blew up
I would say that Go is replacing C++ in some way, not C
Ever since I learned SQL back in the 90s, I always looked down on people calling it SEQUEL, but now I repent and accept it as SQUEAL.
where are the HDLs?
<b>verilog has entered the chat</b>
I program in perl... I am depressed now
I take pride in the fact that I have coded in at least one language on each level. I just wished this mentioned Arnold C...

You are throwing together &quot;difficult&quot;,&quot;low-level&quot; and &quot;obscure&quot;. Theese also contradict each other, as Objectoriented programming <i>is</i> difficult - it only makes a few things easier (like vector math) at the cost of speed (memory allocation). Also the many hatred for Java, doesn&#39;t come from beginners, complaining about types. It comes from C-Programmers that critisice OOP. C and Java also happen, to be the two most popular languages, so there is naturally some geek-rivality, as there is rivality between sports fans. Assembly is also fairly easy to learn.
&quot;most production code out there is not functional&quot; <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pEfrdAtAmqk&amp;t=345">5:45</a> — I love quoting that out of context 🙂
I bet this video will blow up internet, and become #1 viewable video on this channel

VLSI design boils down to two things: Flipflops and gates. Flipflops are 1-bit memory cells, driven by a clock signal to accept the next state
&quot;Wonder if PHP is any good&quot; — that got me to laugh out loud, thank you!<br>(and then I remembered the performance improvements Facebook did to PHP)
I already ask myself the same question everyday like Wtf I&#39;m doing I don&#39;t even like coding or engeneering? Just following someone else dream to make money out of it to survive that&#39;s all? I&#39;m still not living my own dream..And Yes you&#39;re also too who are watching this, we&#39;re all nothing but followers who can&#39;t make our own decision or being forced to walk on this path, just for money We&#39;re bind on a system not of human chain but humans bind in chains by Parents over them comes Society over them Government. I hate this it feels so Dark now......
Any Unidata users here? -.-
Amazing that you said Java was big because it had a jvm… smalltalk already had everything that Java had  but dynamic and not ugly statist typed..
I live in Russia and in our schools we still learn Pascal. I think, our government wants to make nerd-nation. In fairness, in some schools teach &quot;Кумир&quot;(&quot;Kumir&quot;, Idol), which like a BASIC, but in Russian and more modern with cool graphic mode, or even a Python.
What the hell bro
Love this video ❤❤

(real thing to learn is how to communicate, will always stress this with devs.)<br><br>It&#39;s so stupid seeing people get hung up on tech when you can just, look at some source code and read some docs to understand how something works, where you can<br><br><b>Leverage team members who know how to use a language</b> and ask them questions to <b>understand how a language works</b> and then just, make cool shit from there.<br><br>We have mouths. We should use them, no matter how embarrassing as it is. People still come into teams where we have to assume they don&#39;t know anything, that way they can build themselves up.<br><br>Hardest dev job I had was actually not even about code, it was about <b>our middlewre infrastructure</b> and having to understand all of that mumbo jumbo with grafana, yaml files, migrating between GCP and Azure and Open shift, setting up alerts on pagerduty, and I just wanted to code, man...
wow, that escalated slowly
isn&#39;t low level c++ just c code written in .cpp files and compiled with c++ compiler?

the lowest tier of the iceberg is what i learn in my undergrad physics, and it is useless
Excellent video, but for the joke of the last part, I want to add something too. People that think that reality is just what is inside you are worse than people in the past that thought that Earth was the center of the Universe and was 5,000 years old.<br><br><br><br>There are two realities, objective reality outside you (The Universe) and the lousy copy that your brand tries to reproduce in you (and what you have access to). There are always problems if you forget one or the other.
nice vid. to add a few that might not ought to be in the software dev ice berg, but quite interesting. between machine code and logical gate, there are register transfer level programming language like Verilog and VHDL, you can write how you want your circuit to behave and some synthesizer can transfer them into gates layout. <br><br>also for logics and math, you got things like coq and isabelle
the visuals made me crack up ahahha
What about perl?
Nice to hear someone talking about the advantages of many languages withouth need to bulshit about how one is better than other. BTW, missing the comment about my prefered language: Perl :)
Am only person who didn&#39;t notice Perl
This video was fun for old timer in the field but has no value whatsoever for people entering in the field. Don&#39;t worry and stop over thinking what to learn. The best job in this field is when your title is not programmer but you actually program to do your job. Programming is a skill and will be less and less a &quot;job&quot;.
Ada Lovelace was instructed how to take the notes she did. She is not the first programmer. She took notes in a style in which she was trained. People are only calling her the first programmer because we want to appeal to the sort female vanity which says “us ladies are the real brains and men take all the credit”. We do that because we’d like to be loved by those women. But vain women can’t love you. So you doom yourself never to be loved.
The amount of energy - research you put in each video is amazing, it&#39;s always great to watch. especially love the way it&#39;s presented with combination of humor. cheers Jeff
HTML has as much to do with programming as Paint, it is a language tho.
This is why I realize that you must learn how to code instead of learning where to code...
Not cool bro the intro,
Pharo! Does it qualify as a separate language, or is it only a concrete implementation of Smalltalk?
The last part of this video is gold

PHP:  <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pEfrdAtAmqk&amp;t=194">3:14</a> &quot;and is still very popular today&quot;... wait what? Absolutly not. <br>There are still websites which are written in php because they are old and simply rewriting those would cost to much money. So actualy at this momemt in time I could not think about any reason to learn php. Everything you would need php for you can to with js aswell. Html + CSS + JS + SQL -&gt; puff web-developer. Hf
Coll vid, thanx
what are you ? <br><br>ahahhah you have been probably imported from another universe ahahah
nice Socrates finish xD
where&#39;s matlab? still computing ha
Lsd is a hell of a drug. I think we can go another level lower than this Fireship.
Since transistor is forcing it already.
I watched this video till the end. Now Im just proud of myself for nothing.
My route was quite weird when I started. Since I saw my brother doing SystemVerilog + UVM (very, very low level languages...or hardware description languages that use digital/sequential logic for verification purposes). I had 0 knowledge of electronic or programming. Was learning it for 1.5 years and couldn&#39;t manage to get a job since I had no degree in electronics and I knew much more than interns that were applying (since I finished their courses, that are done in a team, alone). I&#39;ve been actually told by interviewers that I know much more than others but I will not be accepted only because of my degree, not even joking.<br><br>So I just started learning programming in C++ and Unreal Engine. Not even basic C++...straight into Unreal C++ and...that was painful with no knowledge of basics of C++. Couldn&#39;t get a job there since only 1 company used Unreal...so went to C# and Unity and landed a job in 3 months time.<br><br>What I want to say is that my path was completely reversed...which was a terrible idea but it just shows that you don&#39;t need to do things in order to make it it just takes a LOT longer to achieve your goal if you do it by my order. When I came to learn C#...took me a day/two and that was it. SV + UVM made me learn how computer function and how to think logically, C++ thought me how to code and think about memory and C#...thought me that things would be so much easier if I started with that (haha). <br><br>Also, learn what is popular at your country for your market. C++ was a huge mistake since no game company here uses it (except...2 right now) but it&#39;s ok to make a couple of mistakes, that&#39;s how you learn the best.
Shine on, you crazy diamond!!!
I think you haven&#39;t fully explain stack oriented programming language.
This video is so good it&#39;s weirdly arousing. If you had not butchered the name Piet (Mondriaan) as PIYET the effect of this video on my pants would have been catastrophic.
An iceberg within an iceberg.  That&#39;s an interesting concept.  Hard to imagine though.
this video took quite a turn towards the end
I remember the sad sad years I tried to learn to code.  I finally gave it up when I re-invented the shovel and the  rake. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTWKdwc_tiQ">https://youtu.be/TTWKdwc_tiQ</a>

Never tried scratch or basic but based on languages I&#39;ve tried visual basic is what you should start with for app, python for scripting, and HTML for web are easiest to start with
Started as a programmer, ended as a philosopher.
Am i the only guy here who absolutely loves Java ? i mean it&#39;s beautiful lol.
Jeff is I think the only developer/YouTuber out there who really makes coding and programming really fun, Last year I was binge-watching his 100s videos in class instead of actually studying, and i have this weird thing where if i have to break down a problem, i use fireship&#39;s voice in my head and the problem solving goes easier<br>Thanks man, you&#39;re doing a wonderful job.
Nothing on Perl? Really!!
🥲
This video basically made my entire channel useless, every topic I&#39;ve covered was mentioned in one way or another

Crème de la crème: Python, JS (+ HTML + CSS), Go, Rust, V, Carbon.<br><br>Even though you can usually get <b>anything</b> done with either of these languages, knowing all of them will make you feel absolutely relevant and future proof for the next decade at least.<br><br>Even though I absolutely love C++ to bits, I can see Carbon becoming a cool new &quot;revival&quot; to it, compared to Rust.
One unmentioned historical language is D. It is important because it failed to replace C++ which is why C++ is such a mess now; rather then creating progressively better languages, the ISO resorted to creating new &quot;versions&quot; of C++ which are backwards compatible like C++ is to C. These are changes just as big as the original C to C++ transition and we are on our 5th version(6th version of C) with the same name. It should be called C++++++++++++

HOLY C really crack me up 😂
What about Delphi?
A very good video.  Great to hear about brainfuck again
I disagree that rust is all that well liked.  It’s like a great deal by a very tiny number of people.
C++ does not make it easier to shoot yourself in the foot than C.  It has a few nice additions to C, but also a number of features that are really sort of useless.

Down to C, C++ and Rust which I have all done, infact i started with C++.<br>I never got into GO, I ignored Dart and Swift. Somehow I just managed to skipp the entire row of &quot;functional&quot; languages. Other than that, I did everything so far except Scratch.<br>I think Batch and no-sql needs to be added somewhere up top. I will be skipping all the &quot;modern&quot; and my next langugage have been COBOL for a while now.
No assembler?

Where is my loved VBA. The only language I know and actually get paid for ^^
V is not memory safe as it stands at the moment, that&#39;s a false claim by the author. I suggest reading &quot;V is for Vaporware&quot; and &quot;V Update - June 2020&quot;. There&#39;s not even a proper memory management system in place. Autofree is a broken or non-existent feature. And that&#39;s not to talk about the community. Wowee.
All this research, and he fails to mention Objective-C.
We hear a lot these days about the dignity of human nature. It is quite true that man was an excellent creature when he came out of the hands of God; but if we consider this question, given fallen man, as depraved by sin, how can we join with the Psalmist, in wondering that the great God can remember him? Fallen as man is from his state of original happiness and holiness, his natural faculties and abilities are sufficient proof that the hand that made him is Divine. He is capable of great things. Your understanding, will, affections, imagination, and memory are noble and amazing faculties. But seeing him in a moral light, as an intelligent being, unceasingly dependent upon God, accountable to Him, and appointed by Him to a state of existence in an unchanging world; considering this relation, man is a monster, a vile, low, stupid, obstinate, and malicious creature; there are no words to fully describe it. Man, with all his intelligence and vaunted achievements, is a fool; while he is destitute of the saving grace of God, his conduct, as his most important concerns, are the most absurd and inconsistent, then, what the cruelest fool; concerning his affections and aims, he degrades himself far below the beasts; and by the malignity and malice of his will, he cannot be compared to anything so properly as to the devil. The question here is not about this man or that man, a Nero or an Elagabalus, but about human nature, the whole human race, except the few who are born of God. There is indeed a difference between men, but it is due to the restrictions of Divine providence, without which earth would be the very image of hell. A wolf or a lion, while in chains, cannot do much harm, as if they were released, but nature is the same in every species. Education and worry, fear and shame, human laws, and God&#39;s secret power over the mind, combine to form many personalities that are outwardly decent and respectable; and even the most lost are under a restraint that prevents them from manifesting a thousandth part of the wickedness that is in their hearts. The man is a fool. He can really measure the earth and almost count the stars; he is rich in the arts and inventions of science and politics; and shall he then be called a fool? The ancient heathens, the inhabitants of Egypt, Greece, and Rome, were eminent in this kind of wisdom. They are to this day studied as models by those who aim at excellence in history, poetry, painting, architecture, and other endeavors of human genius, which are suited to polishing the manners, without improving the heart. But its most admired philosophers, legislators, logicians, orators, and artists were as destitute as madmen or children of that one knowledge that deserves the name of true wisdom. Claiming to be wise, they became fools (Romans 1:22). Ignorant of God, but conscious of their own weakness and dependence on power above their own, and stimulated by an inward principle of fear, of which they knew neither the origin nor the right application, they worshiped the creature in Instead of the Creator, yes, they put their trust in wood and stones, in the works of men&#39;s hands, in vanities and chimeras. A familiarity with its mythology, or religious fables, passes us by a considerable branch of learning because it is drawn from ancient books, written in languages ​​not known to the vulgar; but at the point of certainty of truth, we can receive as much satisfaction from a collection of dreams as we can from the ravings of lunatics. If, therefore, we admit these sages admiring them as tolerable specimens of humanity, shall we not confess that man, in his best condition, yet being entirely uninstructed by the Spirit of God, is a fool? But are we wiser than they are? Not at all, until the grace of God makes us so. Ourmore markedlyantages only show our madness more markedly. Why are all people counted as fools? A fool has no common sense; he is ruled entirely by appearances and prefers a fine coat to the deeds of a large estate. He doesn&#39;t consider the consequences. Fools sometimes injure or kill their best friends, and think they have done no harm. A fool cannot reason, for arguments are useless to him. At the same time, if tied with a straw, he dare not move; at another time, perhaps, he is hardly persuaded to move, though the house was on fire. Are these the characteristics of a fool? Then there is no foothe ke the sinner, who prefers the toys of the earth to the happiness of heaven, who  s held captive by the customs of the world and is more afraid of the threats of man than of the wrath of God. <br><br><br>- Rick and Morty Cartoon to show :<br>There is indeed a difference between men, but it is due to the restrictions of Divine providence, without which earth would be the very image of hell.

“that make all the other soy-based languages possible“ 😂
Have to agree with c++ blowing your whole leg off. I was doing my highschool final exam in computer science and had troubles going to the collage because I couldn&#39;t do the programming part properly. Questions were stupidly easy but I couldn&#39;t make it work, even thou I did the same type of coding at home and it went flawless. Ended up with the score of 44% (ultra bad for where I am, big sadge) (also we had like no time at all so you either did it on the first attempt or you didn&#39;t do the thing)<br>I am going to a private collage becasue of it.
tested on ios12 as well. so far it&#39;s good to use
What about Autohotkey (high level compiler language)
The monad joke really is timeless. I laugh just as much at it today as the first time I heard it years and years ago.

You might find this interesting but there is an arabic functional programming language calles QALB developed by a lebanese engineer :<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qalb_(programming_language)">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qalb_(programming_language)</a>
This Video is so beautiful
&quot;Highly optimised software&quot; and you show UE?<br>Ahahaha best joke.
All these wonder languages to replace C are nonsense. I program microcontrollers and do not find it a problem doing my own memory management. C is everywhere in the world of microcontrollers. It&#39;s usually C with a bit of the C++ for libraries. I think, like everything else, object orientated stuff was a fashion that came and went, and now it is used when it make sense to use it, rather than to create a program which can be difficult to debug. I also think working at a low level is not as tedious as many imagine because if you use a lot of high level functions you need to know their exact behaviour under all conditions or else you might get spooky behaviour which is difficult to track down. C is good because it is logical and neat. i see it like classical Greek architecture: there is no better way. What you do find time and time again though is trendy stuff that is buzz of the month say, and then disappears just as fast and these days every Tom Dick and Harry is writing a language. You will invest a lot of wasted time trying to be trendy. I learnt the hard way with M$ languages. They will leave you with code no one can maintain. They will dump it and move to an entirely incompatible system so you buy it all again. C is the Latin.

&gt;Pharo mentioned<br>Now that&#39;s a win in my book.
I was actually taking serious notes and noticed the slow descent into madness and was like &quot;wait what?&quot; 😂 ... The ending was so hilarious lol
C is easier then C++? Sure the latter has much more stuff to be aware of, but in essence it&#39;s just bare bones oop, and once you wrap you head about the memory and streams shtick, all is bueno. C? Not only memory, but os calls, diy data structures and an ability to kill your OS as a bonus. No low-level is easy. You need to build with stick and stones, instead of OOP lego sets.
When I bought Turbo Pascal v3 one of its selling points was that it had eliminated the p-code virtual machine and was, finally, compiling to machine code (most of which was now calls into the language runtime in the bottom of the .COM file, but still). That was in the early eighties, and I was surprised to learn that Java had taken the retrograde step of reinventing the virtual machine.
I am here just to hear someone talk about Haskell
I loved how you concluded the video.  I need a bong hit now.

this is gold man. <br><br>basically saying everyone hates java is gold<br>&quot;soy-based languages&quot; is gold<br>&quot;which got that name because they&#39;re as dangerous as pointing a gun at someone&quot; is gold<br>the end was absolute gold<br><br>thank you.
Knowledge inception
c is so easy, so is assembly, get on my level. actually nandgame is sorta hard but still im better
&quot;[C++] provides many opportunities to not only shoot yourself in the foot, but blow your entire leg off. This is a reference to manual memory management with pointers&quot;<br><br>No, it isn&#39;t. You can write entire applications in C++ and not touch a pointer once. The memory management of C++ is entirely <i>unlike</i> that of C, being based instead on value/move semantics and lexically scoped allocation and destruction, which takes care of 99% of needs while keeping performance predictable and deterministic (no random GC pauses). If you&#39;re manually managing memory in C++, you&#39;re almost certainly doing something wrong. The footguns of C++ are related to the fact that it has many complex rules with many exceptions that can bite you.

best quote  i&#39;ve ever heard  &quot;if you wannna make money, learn COBOL😐😐&quot;<br>I was like WTF😂😂😂😂
From educational video to existential crisis in 16 minutes. Thanks.
first thing first in current century  people are living that much to learn all of these languages, most people of the current generation are dying in their 60s .life is short , so just learn python , php and html css javascript with some of their frameworks and live life peacefully
Here I am, studied mathematics, did a PhD, never really did lots of programming. And now I am doing ARM assembly. But I love it. It is so close to just being math.
I was kind of hoping you would show how programming and transistors come together with HDLs, like VHDL. The difference between a concurrent and a consecutive programming language would have been a good thing to really explain. And, also maybe how assembly becomes machine code. But hey I know these things aren&#39;t important to developers, only engineers.
The only thing I really know, I know nothing!
idk  if I am the only one hearing the background noise at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pEfrdAtAmqk&amp;t=897">14:57</a>
I think that your videos are extremely educational, but you always skip an important part of becoming a programmer: learn how to understand and create algorithms comes before using a language. Coding it’s like writing, programming composing an article/essay. Learning syntax and language without understanding algorithms and system functionalities (kernels, daemons, networks, etc.) will always leave you limited don’t you think? Languages are easy to learn since they are just a tool, but the way of how to think about programming is way more important
Wow, that escalated quite fast :D
Thanks, very inspiring. Nice glimpse how deep&#39;s go the rabbit  hole!
Jokes a side, this video should&#39;ve gone from the lower iceberg level to the top.<br>Great video informative and fun.
I somehow missed Perl being mentioned :/
You skipped one in the bottom layer: microcode lays between machine code and transistors. No one not working for a CPU producer will dabble with it, but it is still an entry
Malbolge looks like a regex on steroids 😆
Who else using Golang?
You could have also mentioned the Rockstar programming language, the goto choice for becoming a Rockstar developer.
Knowledge is not our memory, but is the essence of which tools to use and have them ready at our disposal when an idea strikes our mind
Forth also deserves a mention -- or did I miss it? <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forth_(programming_language)">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forth_(programming_language)</a>
Can you guys do also F# in 100 secs ?
Often people ask me what programming language to learn. I always say first of all you should have a purpose and then you should select the language accordingly. For example if you wanna be a web dev then simply go for HTML, CSS and JS . For Android go for Kotlin, Swift, JS and Dart etc...
Legit got some college PTSD when I saw the assembly language and logic gates.
Dude!! You need a medic ?? <br><br>It was so fun at the last burv. Seriously I thought you will ask to invent the universe. Appreciate your effort to make us all laugh with insanity of programming.
LoL that Jesus Christ convinced me to click  🤣🤣🤣🤣
This was actually such a useful video with good summaries of what to learn for what and what is used for what and what language came from what. Before watching this video, all the languages seemed very confusing to me.
I&#39;ve always wanted to learn assembly
Hi
This is the best comedy channel for coders.  I laughed so hard, HOLY C~!
Rip Terry Davis. ✝️
I&#39;m considering learning haxe since you can compile it into multiple languages
bro, your humor is on another level🤣🤣🤣
where&#39;s react native
Perl 😭
Beautiful work of art. Best video seem so far.
Can you do the God tier game developer roadmap
who the fuck are you man!? i just love your videos, its just too awesome sometimes, holy C man! bfuck! i am trying to break in and videos like yours are such a break to dev life frustrations
I think therefor I think I am I think, also don&#39;t count your&#39; apples before they hatch or your&#39; chickens will come home to shake their cart.
Oh God damnit, I&#39;m back to questioning if I am me. Happens every time I try learning about programming languages.
First minutes of the video: &quot;cool so many languages&quot;<br><br>Last minutes of the video: &quot;Life is suffering the only thing that we know is that we don&#39;t know nothing&quot;
🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣 what a great end!... Definetly It fell that way... 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
what abt Dlang
I think i may quit learning Java now
i only went pascal deep and that&#39;s enough
is this good for bitcoin?
I wish I could make every 6month- programming-seminar graduate that comes through my door for an interview watch this till the end.
cant believe i got existential crisis from a programming video
Can&#39;t believe that Rockstar Programming Language was not mentioned 😢
That&#39;s what I call premium content.
Man assembly code rly should not be at the bottom I use that to code my arduino its easyy
rust is the ultimate soy language judging by their community. DWM is still written in C. Sorry
I can just die now 👁👄👁
Thank you !! Thank you for making this video.... Help me understand so much..... Thank you
I was a rare species that started with C++ and went all the way down lisp, later struggle to float up to soydev realm of javascript.
Where is pascal ?
Then my parents questioned why I left university and started to code on my own, when we went from 0 coding knowledge to scratch, to python, to assembly. Remember that the most challenging thing we did in python at that point was a search for prime numbers. I had to do a word search game using assembly.
top de mais ajudou muito
Great but you forgot Forth!!!!!
Classic!
lmfao mandlebro
No one hates Java for being typed, don&#39;t fool people. We hate it because the language design makes it objectively horrible.
thx
What an outro
What an outro
I&#39;m that &quot;friend in Vietnam&quot;
I believe things got a little out of your control after the quantum section... The ultimate programming language will be that that allows the creation of connections like the human mind. But to achieve this we need first to understand more about how the human mind works. Thanks for the video.
I did grew up with programming Motorola mk68k assember then I was a kid in the 90&#39;s. After that diving into C on the UNIX.<br><br>C is still my favourite language still today and I use it for some of my own micro-services in Kubernetes. One can do both high level and low level in it, fiddle with individual bits in memory addresses or write very large modular applications.<br><br>Manual memory management have never bothered me, I never had an issue with it.
somehow that made me want to open vsc

Technically assembly can be translated 1 to 1 to machine code. So learning machine code just requires a reference sheet for what the opcode for each command is.
man where can i get that c/c++  learning meme<br><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pEfrdAtAmqk&amp;t=459">7:39</a>

The title was an appropriate selection for the content in this video, and I agree that this is a great representation of &quot;God-Tier Software Development&quot;.
HTML is a HyperText Markup Language, which is not a programming language as it doesn&#39;t contain instructions to be executed.
I really like the turn this video took in the end
I absolutely loved it.
Yeah I&#39;ll go for the last one thanks for the encouragement 👍
Vietnamese here. Games, anyone?
Subbed just for that ending, great vid
Ah yes, PHILOSOPHY<br>My favorite programming language.
Listen mate, I am not trying to sound like a dick but your &quot;ssss&quot; (sibilant) sounds are EXTREMELY annoying. Just use a de-esser and fix it.
I Would add Idris, Agda and Coq to that list!
I&#39;m a JS developer, and I had to learn Asm for my uni degree. wtf.
Why do you edit out every pause in your voice-over? It&#39;s bloody unbearable and monotone.
holy C hahahahahahaha
I understood 3 words from this video. Upvote
Holy shit
Many years ago in college I heard, “Real programmers can write FORTRAN code in any language.”  🙂
Where is Game of Life?
Programmers can do so much with their life. But no, they decide to invent a ton of programming languages just to make their lives harder. This is when ego gets in the way. At this rate, only AI will be able to keep up with all the programming languages out there.
&quot;Chicken&quot; is missing!
That&#39;s it, the image at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pEfrdAtAmqk&amp;t=981">16:21</a> is what I needed to prove that you&#39;re a flat earther, Fireship. Gotta be honest, I always had a hunch...
And all the coding I thought existed was the green floating text in the Matrix 🤔
Really good and interesting video. Also thanks for not calling &quot;C#&quot; &quot;Microsoft Java&quot; and saying it&#39;s only used for game development. As a full stack .NET developer this always makes me cry.<br>I&#39;ve also mingled with C and Assembly and have also written a basic bootloader and 32-bit kernel.
That ending was awesome
i know some of these words
LIFEF**KED
I absolutely love your rambling.<br>I really wonder what why you need a psychologist when you can share your thoughts with the entirety of youtube!
Cute. Thanks
Iam no programmer. May ask you why most of the programming work section, if not whole, is so bad? I always read negative / pessimist comments about their jobs on programming.
Can you stop being incel
I do like it when programming and philosophy are mixed.
Knowing one language is fine.<br>Everything else you can learn when it&#39;s needed.
this helped me think in a different way, what is reality?<br>maybe i don&#39;t need to deallocate that memory...<br>maybe i don&#39;t even need sys32<br>i am free!!!!!!!!<br><i>Exception thrown</i><br>_ERROR AT LINE 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,..........455<br>windows could not find .......<br>black screen<br>......(Meet God)
Yes, I know this is evaluating languages but the libraries/frameworks associated with PHP/JS two are so far apart in required skill level. PHP level 3 and JS  level 2??? PHP is an unevolved OOP joke. FP JS/TS is WAY more challenging to master. O, and I used PHP for over 15 years (CodeIgniter, Laravel, Cake, Zend, RESTful APIs, MySQL etc.). I&#39;m really glad I got away from OOP. And ye, Java (not Spring), C# etc. is also unevolved junk.<br><br>React, React (Tanstack) Query, Redux, hooks, immutability, GQL, RxJS, Chakra UI, Node.js, MongoDB VS Laravel/.NET MVC is not even remotely close in complexity.<br><br>Be careful implying that JS is easy cuz we have enough fools making chaos in our JS ecosystem thinking it&#39;s an easy language to learn.
Insane ending 🤣

If you can use the word &quot;knowledge&quot; and go on then you <b>know</b> perfectly well what the word means! The reason philosophers can&#39;t come up with some bloody necessary and sufficient conditions for something to be knowledge is because there is no reified essence! It&#39;s just a word with varied uses. Philosophers are just people whose intelligence has been bewitched by the form of language and now can&#39;t stop hunting for general essences and defintions.
bro went to deep
Missing Forth means missing the entire genre of stack-based languages, -- and that&#39;s an extraordinary thing to miss.  It&#39;d be like doing this and not including Prolog.  (Prolog <b>was</b> included.)  I personally think that -- for anybody who wants to implement compilers or interpreters one day, -- you have to start your education with Forth.  It&#39;s the easiest thing in the world to implement and play with, and it gets you 70% of the way there.
I learned Assembly its not hard like how its look. u just need to know the structure of ur hardware and how the computer works.
You missed out microcode which sits between machine code and transistors.
nice vid but too quick go by
Fck ..
The ending was kind of similar to that of &quot;The history of the entire world,I guess&quot;
I got a PhD in 2020 using Fortran 77 and Common Lisp.  It was like winning a street race in a &#39;57 Chevy.
&quot;modern chad prefers rust&quot;<br>t. ranny
I honestly don&#39;t know how you do it. Bravo!
I learned Raku (perl6) 3 years ago its awesome, we intended to replace java and php with Raku in our new projects.

if you want to have an existential crisis as a programmer watch this video.
Come for the programming language intro<br>Stay for the existential crisis
The “10th year of C++ kick flip into walking into a rake” meme 🤣🤣🤣🤣<br>Sums it up perfectly
But Kotlin developed in St. Petersburg, why Czechia??
Your voice is always so sexy it made me gay.
this video just described the entire journey of a software engineer from pregnancy to the last number he pronounced before death
&quot;I have no idea how it works but It looks cool&quot; I died 💀
Amazing ❤🔥
Challenge accepted
Kotlin was not created in &quot;Czechia&quot;, it was created in Russia by Russian computer scientist/engineer Andrei Breslav, who lived in Saint-Petersburg back then. Kotlin is also an island 30km to the west of Saint-Petersburg. You are welcome.
Zork Implementation Language or gtfo.
Great video, even better ending.
so where&#39;s the rest?
Thank you for enlightening us.
I guess I found my favorite video of all time. This makes me feel all the emotions out there. i&#39;ve seen my birth and death in one video. May god bless you jeff. // *hunger games salute*//
😂😂😂 Amazing....The end is astonishing panorama of the end times....
He very elegant ignored the &quot;Perl&quot; languages event thought they are part of the iceberg ...
I didn&#39;t know how 16mins just passed watching this video.. Great content man! I appreciate the humor you add in your videos.. After work I don&#39;t have to go to comedy videos anymore, just watch the latest fireship upload and get knowledge and have a good time
As we all got to know heroku just decided to stop their free dynos, can you make a 100 sec videp on heroku alternatives?? That will be helpfull ❤️
I rather lift weights and spend time with wife than do manual memory allocation so JavaScript is fine for me XD
javascript is a half finished buggy inconsistent half representation of half of scheme, so... no, knowing just javascript python and basic isn&#39;t enough to &quot;make anything&quot; and you can do a ton of things javascript can&#39;t do by using what javascript was made to be but embedded in the netscape browser: scheme
Point In my career where I thought my path is sorted with languages I know, after this video I fill like I’m nowhere
Came for iceberg! Stayed for the existential ending!

What about hardware description languages like Verilog?
V stands for Vaporware.
Sh*t went from 0 to 10000 not so quick....
V is kinda of a meme language. It doesn&#39;t really hold up to its claims of memory safety.

Pretty good stuff.  Maybe CUDA was missing?
SBCL + CLOS is the world most powerful OOP, and it&#39;s not a close 2nd. Not to mention ELisp + Emacs. I definitely wouldn&#39;t consider lisp to be a &quot;historical language&quot; outright, but I really don&#39;t know where on the list it should&#39;ve been, so I guess that is the best spot for it.

Once upon a time in college i had to take 1 programming course which consisted of learning the basics of caml,  haskell, scheme, pascal and racket.  Seeing how low they are in the iceberg i now understand why i and my colleagues failed so many times.

Please don&#39;t recommend scratch, I find it more difficult than normal programming hahaha
Programming might not rise to Hemingway&#39;s iceberg, but there is some dignity of movement. Some of the old Borland RAD tools (CBuilder, Delphi-OP, JBuilder). More fun than what ran on the 370s and DECs. Cross compilers, decompilers, disassemblers. I don&#39;t do this crap anymore.
God-Tier being in the title isn&#39;t click bait. At the end you really went deep enough to find and kiss him.
For some reason been waiting for years for you to finally bring up R lol!
I actually had to do Prolog for uni and it was pure torture.
why do you need object orientation?? just use structures.
I learnd basics of python with just a text editor and i still use it for hobby projects and realy love it, i learned JS with inteliJ and i just learned to hate it.

What’s up with the USA
Wow, that got philosophical real quick and real deep in the last few seconds there!
great video fun fact i live in country in north africa they teach us pascal and was my first language to use and learn i study now cs and they change the system in high school they teach kids python insted another fun fact they teach them in the same year js ,html5,css and php and boy oooh boy they think it hard because they have to use ; and {} 😢
&quot;which is named after the eighth circle of hell in the divine comedy&quot; I died 🤣🤣
Started this video as &quot;Oh youtube suggested something again, I don&#39;t know why I would watch it, but anyway&quot; and ended with the knowledge why I as a computer science student have to learn ML, prolog, small talk ....  Not even our teacher managed to explain why we need to learn this. Awesome video, love it!
It&#39;s good to mention that Kotlin can be used as a pure functional programming as well.<br>In Kotlin, you have first class functions where you can pass functions as parameters, assign them as values to variables and modern lambda&#39;s as well.<br>The other great feature of Kotlin which I missed in this video was the null-safety miracle which I think will put Kotlin on top of most languages today.<br>Cheers!
Pascal is not only a historical language which was very popular at some time, it&#39;s also designed to learn programming.<br>It&#39;s actually the perfect language to crack the ice berg from a very low point completly open.<br>startWithLearningPascal();<br>if IUnderStoodPascal() == true then learnC() else learnJS();
No D? Cursed.
Well, this went from some programing languages to questioning reality real quick.

Dude, I honestly can&#39;t imagine how you write the scripts for these videos. Always some amazing content with a vast amount of knowledge 🥲 You&#39;re a legend, dude. I think we can consider this kind of script writing a whole new level of neuro-programming 😅
I was laughing the entire video, good job 😄C++ also added type checking which C didn&#39;t have at the time and a lot more features, but if I could give advice to anyone I&#39;d say don&#39;t rely on C/C++ if you want to be hired and have a career 😂
It&#39;s really cool you added the countries of origin of all the languages. For a lot of them I never thought they were from where they are!
I think rust should be in both high-level static and  systems, since its a viable alternative to both java/go and c++ thanks to its compiler and libary ecosystem. you  can easily combine high level cli parsing checked for safe memory management and modify a varible in ways that  can create memory leaks with c in a the same app.
your videos as always packed and factually accurate
my favourite programming language is html
I feel that some of the 2nd last and last places should swap? Not sure what the list is trying to achieve. Either from &quot;easy&quot; to &quot;hard&quot; or from &quot;high level&quot; to &quot;low&quot; level? I have a bit of experience assembly and would much rather program with that as with something like Malbolge. But anyways, keep up the good videos!
So, Philosophy is the computer science of the human being? I knew it was useful for something

Now I have a headache.
Look, there is this family of very high level languages, they are called &quot;natural languages&quot;. With them, you can actually go to one more layer of abstraction and convey poorly defined idea to programmers. <br><br>They are a bit tricky to use and you&#39;ll find a lot of weird syntax and obscure keywords, but they allow you to completely ignore the whole silicon computer machine. That being said, you still have to sort of convey your idea to a programmer. Now, programmers are carbon based devices, that interface between the carbon and the silicon world, they are fickle and whiny, but if you manage to stroke their ego the right way, you can accomplish a lot with them.
Started with scratch and python and ended with god and consciousness. You really tied all the fields of study together
Why is Kotlin mentioned as Czechia language it was developed by group of people from St. Petersburg right ?
Damn wondered if there is going to be Verilog or VHDL languages but it is not really a programming language even though its visual style is pretty close to it
Gives me strange vibes given my first substantial program was entirely written in binary and since then I essentially just climbed that iceberg upwards.

Just my 10 cents on a tiny detail on the video<br><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pEfrdAtAmqk&amp;t=1001">16:41</a> Ada is actually French, it has been designed between 1977 and 1983 (so first released in 83) under a contract from the US DoD
it took dark turn XD
Now that I watched this I can add 8 years of transistor programming experience to my resume
where is alien language
In my opinion I think that HTML is something on beginner level at least without JS and CSS (raw html)
I think zig acutallly does have a nice metaprogramming approach, it just doesn&#39;t have macros. Zig&#39;s metaprogramming is compile time based
Only Fireship can make such a video! 💯
i like how theres random screaming noises in the background at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pEfrdAtAmqk&amp;t=895">14:55</a>
Quibble: &quot;Logic Gates&quot; should have had the date of 1847, not 1935.  Per the Wikipedia: &quot;Boolean algebra was introduced by George Boole in his first book The Mathematical Analysis of Logic (1847)&quot;  (I don&#39;t know what happened in 1935, first computer maybe?  That wasn&#39;t even vacuum tubes iirc...)
that scaled quickly... help

When you are a Python Dev and have Ophidiophobia
I can&#39;t decide what I hate more. Brainfuck or emojicode.
This video started off milded and ended off connor murphying
When all my 1st year CS courses were taught in scheme it just felt like an unnecessary hurdle to build anything.<br>I switched to an applied CS degree in a heartbeat 😅
While listening to this my brain is slowly freezing up and I want to puke. Thankyou
The best lines: <br>soy based languages. <br>Still used by the department of defense to blow people up.
How dare you skip over Haxe like that 🙁
after watching this video i decided to switch my major for SE to philosophy
The amount of Brazilian programming languages was kinda higher than i was expecting.
Scratch sucks. The idea didn&#39;t appeal to me at all. I even lost interest in learning for a while cause it seemed to me extremely boring.
damn, this guy knows so much<br>it&#39;s like he himself have had wrote all those languages
Everybody forget about jes lol
It is good to dive into it to find the best for you being student, but it is not required to know all of that. You don&#39;t need to be &quot;driver of all types of transport&quot;, but it&#39;s good to know about them. You forgot Forth, D, Vala, Perl
Why does brainf*ck exist when you can do the same thing in JavaScript? :^)
i love how this ends with the cogito
can i start at html,css,and javascript instead of python as a person who want to be a web dev but just step on the proggramming field? (sorry my english is bad)
One life is not enough to become a God-tier developer.
Just poggers
Where are Delphi and Visual Basic?
I really liked, how at the end he has mentioned &#39;always bet on JS you will never lose&#39;❤. That&#39;s very true.
Erlang is not so popular in the telecom industry, even in Ericsson which invented it it&#39;s used rarely and not in the core functionalities. C++ is the main language in telecom.
The more I learn about Lisp and lisp-likes the more I think they were designed by a space alien, I kinda love it
You forgot React bro
The only thing I know that I know nothing
Great breakdown, I know at least one language at each layer of the stack. Computer Systems Engineering requires you know the deepest layers of the ICEberg from C to Assembly all the way down to the Logic Gates. If that&#39;s not enough torture, you can go all the way down to building counters etc with transistors (They just did that to torture us during our studies).<br><br> You missed out on other abstract languages such as Labview and Isagraph, and the legendary Science and Engineering language/tool Matlab. But you covered a vast majority of what the average Software Engineer will encounter in their lifetime. It&#39;s just that Internet Articles and YouTube videos always place emphasis on Web/Game/Application/Data centric languages, when there&#39;s a whole other world out there in Software Engineering.
Calling SQL “squeal” made me bust
HTML isn&#39;t a programming language.
THE GOSPEL<br><br>Moreover, brethren, I declare unto you the gospel which I preached unto you, which also <br>ye have received, and wherein ye stand; 2 By which also ye are saved, if ye keep in memory what I preached unto you, unless ye have believed in vain. 3 For I delivered unto you first of all that which I also received, how that Christ died for our sins according to the scriptures; 4 And that he was buried, and that he rose again the third day according to the scriptures:<br>- 1 Corinthians 15: 1-4 KJV<br><br>Greater love hath no man than this, that a man lay down his life for his friends. - John 15:13 KJV<br><br>SAVALATION <br><br>For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life.<br>- John 3:16 KJV<br><br>For God sent not his Son into the world to condemn the world; but that the world through him might be saved. John 3:17<br><br>Jesus saith unto him, I am the way, the truth, and the life: no man cometh unto the Father, but by me.<br>- John 14:6 KJV<br><br>Neither is there salvation in any other: for there is none other name under heaven given among men, whereby we must be saved. Acts 4:12<br><br>For if, when we were enemies, we were reconciled to God by the death of his Son, much more, being reconciled, we shall be saved by his life. Romans 5:10<br><br>But he was wounded for our transgressions, he was bruised for our iniquities: the chastisement of our peace was upon him; and with his stripes we are healed. - Isaiah 53:5 <br><br>For by grace are ye saved through faith; and that not of yourselves: it is the gift of God: Not of works, lest any man should boast. Ephesians 2:8-9 <br><br>And saying, The time is fulfilled, and the kingdom of God is at hand: repent ye, and believe the gospel.<br>- Mark 1:15 KJV<br><br><br>He that believeth on the Son hath everlasting life: and he that believeth not the Son shall not see life; but the wrath of God abideth on him.<br>- John 3:36 KJV
Verilog/SystemVerilog and other HDLs are missing here. Many of the microcontrollers/CPUs/GPUs are built using them
HTML and CSS should be on the same level as JS
😁Hello Mrs Sophia is legit and her method works like magic I keep on earning every single week with her new strategy..
I started learning in C and it&#39;s still what I feel most comfortable in
I make programs using flutter. My brain hurts
hahaha hahaha Then gave us Java as our first coding experience in college.
Definitely your best video, loved it so much :)
This video is so stupid at the end... I love it!
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pEfrdAtAmqk&amp;t=896">14:56</a> - this is the first time ever that i can hear a background noise in your video!
But the most clean code is written in Whitespace :)
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pEfrdAtAmqk&amp;t=78">1:18</a> What about CP/M 🥺?
Why did I even open up this video and watched the whole video?🙄
what no JCL for zVSE on the list?
School is based on learning C, a bit of C++ and some ASM. It makes me feel like going backward to the programming world
Thanks for the video. Now I&#39;m going to take meds from my psychiatrist. And go learn another language.<br>Afterwards back to work, where I need to restart a vm and run a ps script. Yes, I became a senior programmer to do such things.<br>Learn programming, kids! It&#39;s fun!
This gave me existential crisis
So COBOL?
i think its funny, i skipped type systems and fell in love with functional programming. but also nice philosophical position
brooooooooo the ending !!!!!
the fact that i&#39;m understanding 99% of the content here - memes included - makes me feel very old
Microsoft didn&#39;t develop F#. They renamed OCaml. Change my mind.
I’m Brazilian and didn’t know about those popular languages made in Brazil
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pEfrdAtAmqk&amp;t=333">5:33</a> I love this slide! and the rest of the video too, wonderful, thank you!<br>PS I am missing Forth, the stack based language, or did I overlook that?
I love how it start serious and ends with &quot;the universe is the matrix&quot;. Absolutely genious. Keep it up!
Basic also had lines beginning with a number, so that, in the time of punch cards, when your card deck fell on the ground, you could easily restore your source by sorting the cards. <br>Nowadays we all work with files, it is impossible to imagine how useful that feature could be 🙃
Reality is made of js.
In inter-cal, please was a keyword to make the program function as intended, the reason was that it trew you an exception, &quot;Insuficciently Polite&quot; if you didn&#39;t said please as often.  So you had to be &quot;polite&quot;. But if too much.  Exeption &quot; Too polite&quot;.
Soemtimes I wish my passion for this stupid machine stuck to point where I only searched for cracks for my games and softwares.
no mention of GPGPU? SMH
I can&#39;t stop laughing over the fact that lua is faster than python<br>gosh python is shit
Borland Delphi is missing as Turbo Pascal with OOP and RAD Ui. And of course Visual Basic is missing there too
There is no true god but Allah alone,  and everything except Allah is a little servant of Allah.
Really took a turn at the end there.
is it very strange that I have started and finished with BrainFu*K haha <br>Can&#39;t explain it to anyone
c# &lt;3
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pEfrdAtAmqk&amp;t=976">16:16</a> I see you like Itachi Uchiha
You missed redstone
Great content! A few clarifications though:<br><br>I don&#39;t think SQL is Turing-complete. That&#39;s the reason PL/SQL was invented. PL as in Programming Language.<br><br><br>If you were to say HTML is indeed a programing language you would fail any college exam. It&#39;s a Markup Language, but no more. I&#39;ll take the flak from the &quot;tech community&quot;.
Just learn JavaScript people. Kill the rest. K?
You videos are so good,  it is insane. Keep up your amazing content.
So kotlin is even lower in de iceberg?
I need a serious version of this instructional video that goes into details into all the terms used in explaining programming languages and the differences between them, I studied algorithm, SQL and Sisco level 1 programming but I&#39;m not a developer
Terry Davis was the real OG. Rest in Heaven!
Definitely the best video I&#39;ve watched so far😂🔥🔥
What about Perl and Logo?
Us programmers are joking about low level code - but Minecraft players are building whole computers on the transistor level. For fun. In their free time. <br><br>Redstone might be the most widely used programming language out there.
so starting with pure logic isn&#39;t the easiest way?
❤️🙌🏾
Now I will make new language depressed language after watching this ,that will make ppl more depressed 💀
I can&#39;t believe you totally forgot about butterflies, that&#39;s what real programmers use.
What about smalltalk? kekw
&quot;All but one of the programs cited in her notes had been prepared by Babbage from three to seven years earlier. The exception was prepared by Babbage for her, although she did detect a &quot;bug&quot; in it. Not only is there no evidence that Ada ever prepared a program for the Analytical Engine, but her correspondence with Babbage shows that she did not have the knowledge to do so.&quot; - Allan G. Bromley
Having please as a reserved keyword to make you a more polite programmer 😂
Not trying to bash on HTML, but the fact that it isn&#39;t a programming language is in it&#39;s name itself.
Reported for title mismatch.
Hypocrite that you are, for you trust the chemicals in your brain to tell you that they are chemicals. All Knowledge is ultimately based on that which we cannot prove. Now will you fight or perish like a dog?<br><br>Also I did a literal spit take when you said &quot;Soy languages&quot; lmfao
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pEfrdAtAmqk&amp;t=566">09:26</a> Sh*tCoin. I almost sprayed tea across my screen 🤣🤣🤣
NO! I&#39;m not crying. You are. :&#39;)
Man i hate you 🙁🙁 now I have to learn these languages to know myself 🥲🥲🥲 god help me 🥲🥲🥲bye bye world
The only thing I really know is that I know nothing.
Hi Fireship, I enjoy your videos, but they always feel like a run-on sentence that never give me a moment to process what you&#39;re saying! I was wondering if you could introduce some little breaks instead of removing all of them.
I&#39;m currently studying JAVA, can someone tell me why a lot of people hate it? And should I continue learning it?
Make video about ABAP!
I can relate to this after working with Java dart Swift c# i really don&#39;t wanna go any further 😅😅
I hate Java so much after graduated from college, I applied for a COBOL position.<br><br>It has been a decade now..
Dartmouth sounds like a fantasy institution
Here&#39;s the secret for riches guys but make sure to keep it a secret ;)<br><br>1. Learn JavaScript and Python....<br>2. Build some WebApps<br>3. Beg Venture Capital firms for Money<br>4. Take all the money and invest in the Company<br>5. Lose all the money and also the bloody company<br>6. Do it all over again
yeah actually I&#39;m just gonna stick with javascript thanks
Wasn&#39;t expecting that level of abstraction, but I&#39;m here for it. Now I must re-evaluate all my life choices.
Woah man your right i might still be in that acid trip from when i was in my teens... scary shit 😳
RIP terry
There is an a Indian language is <br>Bhaie language don&#39;t know Google it
As someone that knows VHDL and Verilog and uses it to build firmware based circuits from demand If find this video cute.
what I would like to see is a language so intuitive and easy to write in that anybody could pick it up and make what they wish in a short amount of time.<br>this is not an impossible task, it is quite achievable. if we thought and spoke in binary this would have been achieved the moment we made the first computer. the goal of a programming language is to translate binary to english and english back to binary, each programming language we make is just a new intermediary language designed to make translation easier.<br>this task would be far easier if the program language developers looked at the problem in the opposite direction they do. if instead of starting with binary and translating to english, they started with english and translated to binary, it would be a lot easier to do.
The transition from one language to another was really good.<br><br>Didn&#39;t knew there are so many languages between C++ and asm
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pEfrdAtAmqk&amp;t=17">0:17</a> Not a roadmap, but watching this video is literally all you need.
My two favorite languages to code in are Python and ASM. What does that say about me?
TFW you move UP the iceberg as you get older because you just wanna build dopey web games and get paid to read API documentation
This is a masterpiece
V is actually amazing, hope it will gain traction
I&#39;m glad I&#39;ve programmed something in every tier here except the modern and the ancient languages.<br><br>Also, Rust really is the best
This is so DEEP!<br>I am drowning!
Programming language levels are all about<br><br>&quot;There is this language. It&#39;s cool and all.&quot;<br><i>...but Microsoft created a better one</i>
This video literally F*cked  my brain.
As a mathematician having things like ZFC and Coq at the bottom are dumb af.
My path into software was ideal in retrospect, because I never even started out in school as a software engineer or computer science major, I graduated with an EE who started with C, then C++ (good times doing dynamic gui&#39;s with wxwidgets :O ), and i vaguely remember taking a java course one semester.  Among all the typical Math, Physics and electronics classes, i stumbled across assembly, mips, risc, arm, and x86 and i thought it was cool that I could see how the instruction sets come to be, and how the transistor layouts that they were drilling into us really did make the foundation of modern computer tech. <br><br>Things like how a half adder could be chained to a full adder, and how that could be expanded to make a 32 bit register, and how you could ultimately make an ALU just by stacking these simple parts together, and finally how the CPU is constructed and how opcodes are defined.  Playing the game of swapping C to assembly or vice versa cracked that insight boundary for me, and my job after graduating was data engineering with python, which is still the main language i use today. Bash and Python have served me well :) and Im very happy that the ground up approach I ended up doing, going from the learning the circuits, to the digital logic, to the physical Hardware and finally to the Software really helped me to understand the capabilities and limitations of these languages and really appreciate what it is im doing when im executing code. idk why I wrote all this lmao
Existential crisis on another level
Everyone&#39;s happy until someone pulls out assembly code
you can use vhdl or verilog to describe hardware to fpga, like html describes a websites, this describes logic gates in the fpga. (you can ad this).
Did you make pact in 100 seconds yet?
A like, just for the conclusion that is awesome. Laughed a lot, thank you!
Only Indians know Raju bhai&#39;s pain  <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pEfrdAtAmqk&amp;t=137">2:17</a>  😂
Coool!! Trippy end
i like how dudes with kar98 8x are noobs🤣
I am Taking notes
Didn&#39;t even bring up my 2 favorite languages LC3 and dynamo
Kotlin created by russians. What a lie
The End Is Cool 😎 What is reality?!!
that went dark real fast😂
I use arch btw
You had the Camel up in the graphic but no mention of Perl, sorry Larry I guess it truly is dead.
I&#39;m an embedded systems engineer.  C is my mojo, but assembly is how I get funky, and if you asked me to design chips I&#39;d think I died and went to heaven!
Hello fellow electrical engineers teetering between existential crisis and machine code.
Would like to mention, OM Lang - First Multilingual Programming Language
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pEfrdAtAmqk&amp;t=521">8:41</a> &quot;I have no idea how it works, but it looks cool&quot;. You just summed up my entire programming career
The only thing I really know is that there will be bloodshed.
Dude. Solidity contract called Shitcoin… fucking epic 🤣🤣🤣
all the way down to the depth, i hope i never touch them lmao. cant imagine the stress
My hole computer science undergraduation in a single video
I honestly hope that Julia replaces the need to know all this.. or something eventually
bueno
I like the funny sarcasm but still informative videos that you make bro. <a href="https://media.tenor.com/H6sjheSkU1wAAAAM/noice-nice.gif">https://media.tenor.com/H6sjheSkU1wAAAAM/noice-nice.gif</a>
&quot;and still used today to blow people up&quot;
It&#39;s all true!
contract ShitCoin 😂😂😂😂
That Raju meme though😅
There are only two kinds of languages. The ones people complain about and the ones nobody uses.
I think I never came out from the ayahuasca trip. idk why I was stubborn in high-school and insisted on writing a matrix green chars rain in turbo pascal, but my teacher helped me do it.
Ha. cuz Aaron Rodgers did drugs. I get it
When you mentioned that each programming languages has its own iceberg, I very interested in that possible video
I don&#39;t remember Perl being mentioned...
Lmao squeal
Yo I&#39;m from Vietnam, who wants to play game with me? lol
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pEfrdAtAmqk&amp;t=219">3:39</a> KOTLIN not czechia, JB rus
hahahahhah i loved it :)
we are not worthy enough to view such god tier content. should be banned from internets
shoutout to the kids in the background @14.59
Kotlin is not for mobile only, it&#39;s an OO and a functional language that can be used for many purposes
The next logical step after reaching the bottom of the iceberg is to find out in which language our universe is written. After that, become God.
Programming in Fortran is quite common still if you do large scale linear algebra.
Standing ovation 🎉🎉🎉
This crazy
Yo! I demand that you get more likes for this video 😂😂😂
Well... that escalated quickly...
I always wonder how StackOverflow was built before StackOverflow without knowing anything about StackOverflow. 🤔
Yo can you do one on Digital Ocean ?That would be great thanks.
I only program on whitespace and malbolge
You forgot one of the most widely used languages - VBA.
Amazing
ps: yauasca you dont trip, quite the oposite, it removes the fog so you can see everything as is, some see as trip cause they lived 99.99999% of their lives inside the fog and now when everything is cristal clear is hard to absorve the world without the billion of mental noises they are used to
Ya by the end you are programming in the simulation language by doing different doses of shrooms and other variables like Lsd lol
surprised you didn&#39;t mention perl :)
This is gold. The ending is fantastic. Thanks for making my evening cold bath that much more enjoyable. Hilarious yet informative.
This was fucking pure gold.
Just realized how many of these I actually already know. Crazy how even just starting out you’ll end up having to pickup so many of these languages
Good to know that I code in Chad Level Programming Language. :D
😂😂
bro leave the weed 🤣
The first language I learned was c/c++. And I still use those languages to this day. The lowest I got in this list was asm because I was playing with sectors to make a bootloader.
Great vid, wow!
Supposedly this chef code is actually a pretty decent recipe!
Apparently if you dont use &quot;please&quot; it throws an error at you, until you ask it nicely...
matlab missing
Dlang is missing.
BRAZIL MENTIONED 🎉🎉🎉
I currently learning rust and i love It!
I know nothing 🙈
now the pandora&#39;s box is open! welcome existential crisis 2.0 :P
F*ck this was epic..and man your delivery with puns, sarcasms, and historical facts, pros and cons all are just chef&#39;s kiss!
Salvia is the ultimate programming language as it initiates ego death.

more people need to watch this , I love it !
wow top notch video really funny 🤩
No VHDL? That&#39;s a shame.
This is the single best video I&#39;ve watched related to coding. Clap. Clap. Clap.
I tried learning assembly reversed engineering when I had 2 years programming experience from school-- I stopped the same day I started.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pEfrdAtAmqk&amp;t=864">14:24</a> based terry &lt;3
This is pure entertainment!
At my assembly courses (20y ago) we&#39;ve learned how to code in binary with a mapping table ... It&#39;s not so complicated, it&#39;s just messy and take a lot of time to compute jumps etc ...
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pEfrdAtAmqk&amp;t=201">3:21</a> *Honerable mention: Garry&#39;s Mod <br>:(
I dont know how does python work cuz im c# dev and i still put ; and {} everywhere and  also i alway tipe at the begining using system;
You forgot to mention quantum gravity
Jak tam na chvíli probliklo czechia u Kotlinu tak ngl, zahřálo u srdíčka xD
Best ending of a tech video ever!
Loved that message in the end ❤️
There was a lot of interesting stuff there, but holy sh*t that ending was brilliant 😂👏
i started hyperventilating halfway through the video. like i wanna learn the deeper down languages. but i dont think i want to
LOLCODE, we can make a religion out of this !!!!<br>KTHXBYE.
where is verily or vhdl? they are pretty hard to get into after &quot;usual&quot; programming
I just love C# man
Did you just ignore verilog?
IN college we did C++ I dropped out and now I code in Kotlin lol. Fuck that shit I just like building stuff I don&#39;t like having to handle all that extra shit.
Have you heard of folders? I was 100% sure it would be in the list. It is a language that is written by nesting folders.
The fear and loathing of solipsism is truly the base of the iceberg
Bruh just learn to farm or truck drive.
my mind crashed. i&#39;m done with lie.
Why am I here, why did I watch all of this, I don&#39;t even code.
Really pathetic and awful you failed to mention Delphi in conjunction with Pascal. It&#39;s literally just like C++ and used in very important, large industrial low level native Win32 software development.
So the question is....<br>.<br>.<br>.<br>.<br>.<br>.<br>What is knowledge?
I am a very eccletic programer: I use both Python and FORTRAN 76.
That ending was ridiculous 🤣
C/C++ / Delphi/Pascal. My personal holy low-level-yet-practical combination. Old school in new world.
I&#39;m going to post a job listing requiring all the languages from the bottom of the iceberg to see what freaks live in my neighborhood.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pEfrdAtAmqk&amp;t=864">14:24</a> the schwarze sonne in the background though.... :|
So, any OSTRAJava enjoyers out there? 🔭
Does Stephen Grider run fireship? It sounds like him
Most excellent video my dude &quot;exclamation mark&quot;
Sleeped unexpectedly 😴
This was fantastic!
So why does everyone hate JS😂😂
Julia has types - you can code without them but a program will be slow. When one uses types programs written in Julia will be fast
I am surprised not to see AWK on this list. Why is that?
Bro is an absolute legend.. 😂😂
I want this channel to get more subscribers
Great video. I&#39;d enjoy seeing another iceberg style video from you, maybe covering something like developer tooling.
At some point I knew there was drugs involved.. I thought weed at first but then you ayuhaskad me. Makes sense now
Wow, that was excellent. Thanks!
Raise your hand if you noticed Raju in the video ✋
Vietnamese here lmao
Subbed🙏
HTML and CSS are definitely not Turing complete programming languages, that do not run anything they are formatting languages...
60 SECONDS IN AND I&#39;M DEPRESSED. THIS IS A NEW PERSONAL BEST.
Soy-based languages 😆
Damn, I was hoping to see VDF here. Ah well, the language continues into obscurity.
This video started with programming languages and ended into existential crises
When are you going to do 100 seconds of Scala?
I felt lost like many about learning programming but thanks to people like you I have a clearer vision
Let me just Like this awesome video!
Great video. Tbh, I stopped watching once we hit F#. I’m like, bruh, that’s for music, and I had to get back to work. Great content!
No way to predict that this would end up in hard solipsism, but it was delightful
The only language that can‘t learn is WTDL (WifeTermsDominatedLanguage), my wife talks it since 20 years, but i still dont have learnd it … 😂😇
this is your master piece bro
&quot;or it might just make you depressed&quot; too late I&#39;m already there. xD
I think of life like a video game 🎮 <br>Like that episode of Rick&amp;Morty where Rick lives a virtual life that is for everybody was only an hour but for rick it took a life of 60 years I think.<br>If we are souls therefore we&#39;re only plugged in to a body and we are only here for a short period of time.<br>Just think about it, the world is perfectly designed -dammage in video games is a part of the game design, well life too wase made to experience it not to enjoy it - so death is just another design thing<br>May God guide us all
The real trick to being successful in the programming industry is learning the fundamentals of programming itself, and then applying that knowledge to whatever programming language the job itself requires. At the end of the day, almost all programming languages have similar workflow with minor differences in syntax. Limiting yourself to one language is a great way to corner yourself in a small job market with little to no growth potential.
this was such a dense 16 minutes, i didn&#39;t even move my head while watching
dud, u rly know nothing, huge dis for skipping perl and furier transforms that make bits in your ripple carry adders :D
Love it. Thank you.
... I think I&#39;m good with python and c#. Yup. Gotta stay on those game engines
since your body is a well tuned flesh machine, what if you can develop your own coding language in your mind to control your own actions
FIRE! FIRE! FIRE! SHIP!
The modern languages part surprised me Jeff!
Thank you for including Julia :)
fvck haskell, the most famous of functional languages is lisp :D get your facts straight :D
Man I love Ruby. It&#39;s the language I use the most in my work and it&#39;s so satisfying.
do you really have to censor fuck?
I know nothing for certain, except JavaScript.
Just a correction, Piet is not pronounced &#39;pee-jet&#39;, it&#39;s pronounced almost exactly as pete, closer to &#39;peet&#39;
It&#39;s missing Q# for quantum computing
Huh, there seems to be a background chatter at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pEfrdAtAmqk&amp;t=898">14:58</a>, just noting
PLEASE MAKE <br>A<br>next video - about back4app
Opened this video to check out some weird programing languages to have a laugh and left questioning reality. 10/10
Missing plusCal TLA+, Coq, Agda etc.<br><br>… code modeling languages used by many companies — including AWS and Google — for code correctness
I see how you just swiftly went over that monad part👀
The final level of coding is literally the god tier
The Stackoverflow 1965 survey joke threw me for a second.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pEfrdAtAmqk&amp;t=410">06:50</a> HOW COULD YOU FORGET D?
that existential crisis tho
I think I was born with all the knowledge am right now thinking in the last step. 🤣🤣🤣
Where&#39;s rockstar programming language?
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pEfrdAtAmqk&amp;t=187">3:07</a>, capitan obvious here, on the right, that&#39;s not a python.<br><br>Looks more like a corn snake or a king snake 🐍🐍🐍
FINNALLY, PTSD!!!
german universites:<br>yeah lets start with c and c++ and then fuck them up by teaching them assembly at the same time in the first semester
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pEfrdAtAmqk&amp;t=138">2:18</a> Raju Rastogi was on death bed because he was fired from engineering college and the Dean said he would not land up any job. I don&#39;t know was it really a coincidence that you used that image or was it special chosen. He is a charector from a very famous Bollywood movie &#39;3 ideots&#39;.
You forgot biochemical circuits
Im good at C, C++ &amp; JS but i still struggle at Scratch xD
what about vhdl and verilog ?
That escalated soon 🤣
Was expecting a boring video coming in <br>And he literally took off and wouldn&#39;t let go<br>Great video man
I was not ready for the final tier 😄😄😆😆

Being an Electronics Engineering Students<br>We have already 😅 Faced the deepest language *ASM Assembly language *and *Binary language*.👏
Damn bro went from Java script &amp; python to epistemology and questioning his own existence.
no VHDL or vertilog mention :/
the video got really good at around <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pEfrdAtAmqk&amp;t=975">16:15</a>
:: emphatic slow clap ::👏
&quot;APL - A programming language&quot;<br><br>Lol. Love it :D
This is Raju Rastogi on the death bed 😂
Bro !! Breathe😶..... Absolute😂 bonkers
Good video.
Appreciate the effort good sir.
realy appreciate the k98 sniper from pubg at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pEfrdAtAmqk&amp;t=45">0:45</a> lol

This was an extra good one 😂👍🏼
Where is &quot;Minecraft Redstone&quot;?
Why is pascal lower than c++ , c++ is by far the hardest language on this iceberg to master, also C is appearing twice
Well, this video took a really depressing turn. (Great work btw!)
Raju😂😂😂😂
Computer Science student here, I think it&#39;s a little bit odd to put Assembly at the bottom of the iceberg, because you&#39;ll be expected to learn it in at least one class to get your Bachelors. Interestingly, I don&#39;t think my degree program has me learning any functional languages, possibly because they have yet to update the cirriculum. As for transistors, you might be learning that in your CS program too if it&#39;s not a part of the Computer Engineering program or Electrical Engineering.<br><br>Personally if I was making the iceberg go from &quot;languages you will learn&quot; to &quot;languages you will only learn if you really want to get deep into it&quot;, I&#39;d keep Scratch at the top, followed by Python and Javascript. Basic wouldn&#39;t be at the top since nobody AFAIK uses it to learn programming anymore. HTML or CSS might honestly be in the same tier as Python and Javascript. C++ and Java would be a level below those &quot;beginner languages&quot;, with Assembly only one level below that. Functional languages might honestly belong at the same tier as either C++ and Java or Assembly depending on how popular they really are. The esoteric languages really belong at the bottom here; you&#39;d never program in them unless you just wanted to have a good laugh.<br><br>It&#39;s important to distinguish between how easy it is to program in these languages and how common it is to program in them. Depending on the application, it&#39;s actually fairly easy to program in Assembly if you aren&#39;t having to solve complex math problems (each individual arithmetic operation has to be on its own line in Assembly) and you keep track of which memory caches are in use. The instructions aren&#39;t as easy to read as a high-level language, of course, but the syntax is surprisingly simple, no weird confusing parenthesees or pointers to struggle with. I imagine the same thing applies to some extent to transistors, although in that &quot;language&quot; your mistakes may have the unintended side effect of damaging your components.
raju rastogi
That make all the other soy-based-languages possible
Awww, you skipped over Perl!<br><br>IMHO, perl shouldn&#39;t have been in the same tier as prolog, ADA, Pascal and all that. But I am biased.
As always you didn&#39;t mention D (Dlang), a good successor to C/C++ and a good alternative to Go and Rust.
I started with C then Java to do Standalone Application leaned SQL and then PL/SQL, now doing C++ and Unix in the company I got recruited with because of Java technology :V
Ayahuasca Love!
I love when you do off beat videos like this, My favorite part has to be the section at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pEfrdAtAmqk&amp;t=711">11:51</a> but I think one of the amazing language you missed out here was Folders, where you express the code by creating Folders that follow a certain structure.
Can&#39;t believe we skipped the turing machine and lambda calculus
this is good and all. but where smalltalk focused video?
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pEfrdAtAmqk&amp;t=896">14:56</a> you can hear a child talking in the background
&quot;you don&#39;t want to be on your deathbed wondering if you should have tried php&quot; - as someone who used php for many years (long ago thankfully), you&#39;re more likely to be on your deathbed wondering why you ever tried php.
kudos for that end man, you ruined my brain more than brainfuck did
&quot;always bet on js&quot; - painful truth
I want to see: Ayahuasca in 100 Seconds
This wasn&#39;t a video. This was a trip.
Bruhh....The ending😭😭
Pretty accurate. Will save to show to people who want to start a coding career. I keep forgetting how complex it may be for a complete noob.
why is Viet Nam
😆 I didn&#39;t think I was gonna recover from that raging garbage collector, but then next minnit there&#39;s Jesus smokin&#39; a blunt 🤣
The further I watch this , the more my brain hurts 🥲 Why you gotta give us existential crisis 🥲
V lang is kinda still figuring about the auto memory thing and it’s not yet on par with Rust model. <br><br>Although the idea is cool.

I&#39;m happy to see that holy C made it into this list.
As an electronics engineer I did every lowest level engineering.
Great video, but why you are so quiet?
I didn&#39;t even watch. I&#39;m just here to say that I freaking LOVE that thumbnail!
what happened at  <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pEfrdAtAmqk&amp;t=897">14:57</a> ?
Just Awesome
You definitely missed DNA as a codding language. It should be right in between transistors and quantum electrodynamics. And maybe organic chemistry after DNA too. <br>Also transistors actually can represent three states: Connected to Hi (+Vcc), Low (-Vcc or ground), and high impedance state e.g. not connected.
I am sad that people have completely forgotten about LOGO, the inventor of turtle graphics. It&#39;s a serious alternative to BASIC.
what...
The description has a typo... now instead of know
Thanks for showing how far the rabbit hole goes.
&quot;Male bulge&quot; LMAOOO

Almost 17 minutes of condensed programming language slander and entertainment. I love it.
Still looking for a good  q u a n t u m  e l e c t r o d y n a m i c s  IDE.....
Javascript is my past, present, and future.. 🧙‍♂️
Never expected the ontological frustration at the end
C++ was made by the Danish🇩🇰 scientist Bjarne Stroustrup and essentielt made by the u.s🤓 C# was made by the Danish🇩🇰 Microsoft compiler team👍 It was the Danish🇩🇰 scientist  Anders Hejlsberg that lead the mayor roll of development. Get your facts straight🤮

I am so happy you said Squeel
Looks more like a black hole 😂

I can&#39;t erase my smile yet... 👍
Marvelous!
If the 100sec series was a story, this would be the big finale. Fantastic, take a bow Jeff
🙌
Someone forgot the infamous Matlab
&quot;The only thing that I know is &#39;I know nothing&#39;&quot;, yes.
Our university actually made us start off with scheme. that was nightmare level shit.
Definitely shouldn&#39;t have gone past <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pEfrdAtAmqk&amp;t=700">11:40</a> with so many people sleeping in the house, I think I woke them all up. Definitely worth the wait to watch it the whole way through though.
Came to learn programming language. Ended up having an existential crisis.
But html is a markup language 😭
You are the first one to suggest using Scratch as a beginner!!! I used it for a few months and I don&#39;t regret it, as it is the reason I got into computers. Scratch is GREAT!
that outro was great!
Kotlin is from Russia not Czechia
Man, you are legendary!
when you shared the image on twitter, I thought it was a meme. Looks like i really judged the book by its cover.
So... basically i recommend meditating so you don&#39;t go all crazy
Roadmap are confusion direction for beginners &amp; intermediator these all created by only few. So, don&#39;t follow these roadmap.  These roadmap will be changed every 6 month. Just master in one with industry standard &amp; look other supportive  few frameworks only.
This was intense.
Lovely to see Scot Wlaschin&#39;s presentation at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pEfrdAtAmqk&amp;t=330">5:30</a>. The dude is one of the modern prophets of Functional and super funny to listen to.
Does anyone else hear voices in the background around <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pEfrdAtAmqk&amp;t=900">15:00</a><br>or is it yous my PTSD from Assembler?
Well this video escalated quickly at the end 😂<br><br>I’m kinda disappointed you didn’t mention Verilog
Programming languages are GAY
haha you really diged down that iceberg as far as possible
This video is literally brain*uck! &lt;3
I only came here for lua
Love it
Call me weird but I think JS syntax is beautiful
Interviewer: What language you prefer to code on?<br>Me: Brainfu¢k.
perfect!
I was hoping to see LabVIEW here. It&#39;s in another realm
I loved the ending, Jeff. Amazing work.
Tbf, Holy-C isn&#39;t esoteric, the creator was just literally insane.
What a video..man..! Fully satisfied 🙂
What about Delply?
No matter how advanced you are, I can&#39;t recommend playing around in Scratch enough. The Lego bricks description is accurate. No matter how jaded I feel about the realities of my job, playing around in Scratch reminds me why I love programming.
😀😃😄😆😝🤣😂
I love how diving deep into the theory of every topic eventually leads us face to face with the undeniable fact that all existence is unknowable and meaningless and even attempting to comprehend the concept of being can lead one to insanity.<br><br>Still beats even trying to read assembly code. Fight me
HolyC is god tier. Anything else is not
Been coding for 30 years or more, pro for more than 20. I enjoyed the video itself, but the ending, that&#39;s where you get my ❤<br>Hadn&#39;t really realized how much overlap there might be with members of my profession and ending up down a rabbit hole of existential concerns
Last bit was exact quotes from indian ancient literature and its exposition with its one of main idea/concept called &quot;Maya&quot;.The literature behind it greatly influenced Matrix movie series which was even acknowledged in interviews by Matrix movie creators
Existential questions aside, this is a great way to organize the mountain of coding languages -- especially as a junior developer who kinda wants to try everything new all the time. Maybe the single most helpful video for answering &quot;what language should I learn next?&quot; Thank you!
vlang seems off, no explanation anywhere how it does its memory managment
If I had seen this 20 years ago I would have not become a software engineer.
have you included thyme? the programming language people can use on Algodoo.
that got existential very quickly
Quick question, everyone that I know is going into CS, IT... just like hundreds of thousands of other clueless highschool grats, how will this affect us? Not in 2-4 years but im talking about in 5-10 years
So this is your first existential crisis video
It&#39;s funny how the ones I love to use most are all at the very bottom of the iceberg.

where is <a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23dlang">#dlang</a>?
Ok. Hard to say if Julia is good for working with data, I&#39;ve never tried. I used either SQL or Python+Pandas.  But it&#39;s great for crunching large ammount of data. I guess way better than Python+Numpy.<br>About most loved languages. I guess you really have to love Rust to use it. So it&#39;s the most loved by a cult of developers which use it voluntarily. I have to use C++, I don&#39;t like so many things about it that I can&#39;t even remember which I hate the most, but I use it professionally and it can do almost everything in it (after messing with CMake files to integrate few 3rd party libraries for days while by this time you do the same in Python without using it ever before)
The closer you are to satori, the less employable you become.
this by far the best video ive ever watched from you, a very good introduction for newbies to discover languages

Ok, I don&#39;t know if it&#39;s a good thing or not, but in school they started teaching us C and Assembly x8086. Then Java and we did somthing with Python and Basic.
Watching this video reminds me of how old I am and how many languages I&#39;ve actually used in my life. Great video but one giant omission Pascal/Object Pascal. How could you for get Pascy?<br>Love your channel keep making vids.
glad to have chosen infrastructure instead
Mark, I know you can see this. I&#39;m ready to get out now
This completely removed all my worries of what language I should be learning thanks XD

That was great. Not only informative but fun and visual as always. You are setting a very high standard Jeff.
I missed Mornington Crescent form the esoteric programming languages. It‘s a bit similar to Chef, but worse. Much worse
Kotlin and Czechnia ..... bro ......
I love it
I&#39;m in love with this

I’d argue that a programming language is a language for programming.  HTML is a hierarchical hypertext content description language, and CSS is a visual styling language, and together they can technically be used as a Turing-complete programming language, but only in the most esoteric proof-of-concept experiments.  They weren’t designed for procedural execution and 99.999% of the time they aren’t used that way.  Just because you can use something for something else doesn’t mean it is that— a car isn’t a shoe even though you could technically park 2 convertibles next to each other and “wear” them as “shoes”.  Same argument for SQL— it’s a database query language that technically has enough stuff from programming languages in it that you could write a program with it (with lots of caveats), but no one ever will for any practical purpose because it would be a horribly slow, memory-hogging, convoluted, barely-functional mess and there’s 100s of actual programming tools available in every environment.
Loved it!

Wtf so all this languages just for who to learn ,thank God we are in 2022 so we wouldn&#39;t go in the process of learning all this after each one comes out 😂😂😂😂

iowaska joke at the end 😂😂😂😂
i will create an esoteric language named &quot;nothing&quot; the syntaxe is extremely easy because there are no keywords. it&#39;s blazingly fast to do the task it was designed to do : nothing.
Quick question, have you actually built something in all these languages? If  not how many have you used?
Maybe you went 1 level too deep there, another one and the machines would&#39;ve stopped you.
I&#39;ll add scratch on my resume
WHO ON EARTH WRITES ALL THESE COMPILERS AND SYNTAX !?<br><br>I&#39;m at work (Jr. S/W Engineer) right now and watching this video just made me wanna give up and question my own existence.
Java: write once debug everywhere<br>Me:
G language from LabVIEW
I&#39;m obsessed with &#39;optimization&#39; and &#39;performance&#39; so I&#39;d love to learn Rust for game dev, knowing full well I&#39;d be torturing myself.
I started watching this wondering how deep the hardest programming language I know would be. Now I feel lowkey insulted
Ok, I think I got it... I&#39;ll NEVER touch a line of code! 🙂
Watching your videos is like necessary pain 😖😖🤤🤤🤯🤯😵😵!!
and Quantum CPU working completely different from &#39;standard&#39; CPU. This means that it&#39;s completely another dimension if we talking about &#39;programing it&#39;. 🙂 For this day, there are only few algorithms (programs). That can be run and utilize QC. Whole teams of scientist working/thinking about to creating new algo/progs, that can be used on QC. As I said before... this is completely another dimension if we talking about &#39;programming&#39;. 😀
SQL is not a shotform for „structured query language. It is just SQL as it is written in the original standard.
Yeah that&#39;s half of the languages a 10 day old startup asked me to have 30+ years of experience in for a software intern position  to indent their python codes, seems legit
According to me the greatest programmers were the folks at stack overflow who made stack overflow without using stack overflow 😂
You only need 2 logic gates to do all others
This video feels very basic and uninformed.
&gt; What&#39;s a monad ? <br>&lt; A monad is just a monoid in the category of endo functors.<br>&gt; ...<br>&gt; yes
FYI Piet is really just the Dutch spelling of Pete, it&#39;s not pronounced like Vietnam xD
This is by far, the best video I have ever seen blending Computer Science, Logic, Mathematics, Philosophy, Science + Memes.
I am deeply shocked that  Rockstar is not in the list.

If Kotlin was made in Czechia then Go was made in Ireland :D
dude this video rocks, hit it out of the park
amazing video, thank you.
Awesome 😄👍🏻
C++ probably has the biggest human accomplishment ratio in a programming language, in the greatest achievements of the humanity based with software.
All the basic programming courses at my university used Scala so I actually started my programming journey from level 5 of this tier list. I think it was a great language to start with, still love it.
Holy shit .
Waiting for the tutorial
I am just seeing your work and research for this video. Exquisite brother. You&#39;re an inspiration.
The Hog Rider card is unlocked from the Spell Valley (Arena 5). He is a very fast building-targeting, melee troop with moderately high hitpoints and damage. He appears just like his Clash of Clans counterpart; a man with brown eyebrows, a beard, a mohawk, and a golden body piercing in his left ear who is riding a hog. A Hog Rider card costs 4 Elixir to deploy.<br><br>Strategy<br><br>His fast move speed can boost forward mini tanks like an Ice Golem in a push. At the same time, he can also function as a tank for lower hitpoint troops such as Goblins as he still has a fair amount of health. Most cheap swarms complement the Hog Rider well, as they are nearly as fast as him and usually force more than one card out of the opponent&#39;s hand.<br><br>The Hog Rider struggles with swarms, as they can damage him down and defeat him quickly while obstructing his path. Barbarians in particular can fully counter him without very strict timing on the defender&#39;s part, though be wary of spells.<br><br>A Hunter can kill the Hog Rider in 2 hits if placed right on top of it. However, if you place something in front of the Hog Rider, the Hunter&#39;s splash will damage the Hog Rider and hit the card in front of it more.<br><br>The Hog Rider in conjunction with the Freeze can surprise the opponent and allow the Hog Rider to deal much more damage than anticipated, especially if the opponent&#39;s go-to counter is a swarm, or swarms are their only effective counter to him. Skeletons and Bats will immediately be defeated by the spell, while Spear Goblins, Goblins, and Minions will be at low enough health to be defeated by a follow up Zap or Giant Snowball.<br><br>However, this strategy isn&#39;t very effective against buildings as the Hog Rider will take a while to destroy the building, giving the opponent ample time to articulate another counter.<br><br>Against non-swarm troops, it can deal a lot of damage during the freeze time, but this can allow the opponent to set up a massive counterpush. For this reason, players should either only go for a Hog Rider + Freeze when they have other units backing it up from a counterattack, or if the match is about to end and they need to deal as much damage as possible.<br><br>It is not a good idea to send in a Hog Rider simply to destroy a building, especially if it is the only building targeting unit available, as defeating Crown Towers becomes substantially more difficult. Spells or simply waiting out the lifetime of the building are more effective. The exception to this is an Elixir Collector placed in front of the King&#39;s Tower. If a Hog Rider placed at the bridge, he can destroy the Collector for a positive Elixir trade, though the damage from both Princess Towers will usually mean he does not survive to deal any damage to them. However, if the opponent sends in defending troops, it can be an opportunity to gain spell damage value.<br><br>In a deck with several low-cost cards, it might be worth it to simply send the Hog Rider against one building. These decks shuffle their card rotation quick enough, that they will arrive to their next Hog Rider before the next building arrives in the opponent&#39;s card rotation.<br><br>Long-ranged troops like Musketeer and Flying Machine can snipe those buildings, preserving some of the Hog Rider&#39;s health, possibly allowing it to get some Tower damage.<br><br>When there are buildings placed in the middle to counter the Hog Rider, understanding the placement of the Hog Rider and the type of building placed can help the Hog Rider to bypass certain buildings.<br><br>Passive buildings such as spawners and Elixir Collector have a larger hitbox than defensive buildings; which means that if a passive building was placed 3 tiles away from the river in the middle of the opponent&#39;s side, then it is impossible for the Hog Rider to bypass that placement as the Hog Rider will get pulled to that building.<br><br>Defensive buildings have a smaller hitbox than a passive building, which means if that if a defensive building was placed three tiles away from the river in the middle of the opponent&#39;s side, a Hog Rider placed at the very left or right side of the Arena may be able to bypass it due to its smaller hitbox.<br><br>If the player has a building already placed down in the center of the arena, and the opponent tries to bypass it with a Hog Rider at the edge of the arena, they can use certain air troops to push the Hog Rider towards the building as it jumps over the river, effectively denying the bypass attempt. They must be already hovering over the correct placement, as very quick reflexes are required to correctly perform this technique.<br><br>For Bats, Skeleton Dragons, and Minion Horde, they should be placed right in front of the Hog Rider as soon as it is deployed.<br><br>For Minions, Skeleton Barrel, Mega Minion, Flying Machine, Electro Dragon, Baby Dragon, Inferno Dragon, Balloon, and Lava Hound, stagger the above placement one tile to the right if the Hog Rider is placed on the left side of the arena, and vice versa.<br><br>They can also use ground troops to achieve the same result. Something like an Ice Golem deployed at the Hog Rider’s landing spot will obstruct his path and force him to go around the unit, which causes him to be closer to the building instead of the Crown Tower.<br><br>The Hog Rider can kite Very Fast non-building targeting troops due to his own Very Fast speed and building only targeting if he is placed on the fourth tile from the bridge, slightly into the opposite lane. He can also stall grounded units when placed right at the bridge. He will pull them towards him while deploying, and then be untargetable by them when he jumps over the bridge. After landing, he will pull them back. This can be useful when the player needs to deal damage in the same lane they are defending. It will also help separate troops behind a tank in a large push.<br><br>A Tornado placed on the second tile front of the player&#39;s King&#39;s Tower and staggered two tiles towards the Princess Tower will activate it without any damage dealt to the Princess Tower, helping them in defending future pushes. This can also be a method of mitigating all damage dealt to a Princess Tower, but doing this more than three times may result in the King&#39;s Tower&#39;s health being low enough to be targeted directly, opening up the possible threat of a back door three crown. A better alternative is to pull the Hog away from the Princess Tower into the attacking range of all three Crown Towers, which will negate all damage as long as none of them are already distracted<br><br>A very powerful combo is the Hog Rider, the Musketeer, and the Valkyrie, typically referred to as the Trifecta. The Musketeer will defend against most troops, while the Valkyrie can protect her and the Hog Rider from swarms or high damage units. The Hog Rider is used to deal damage to the tower.<br><br>This can be effectively countered by Lightning, one-shotting the Musketeer and severely damaging both the Valkyrie and Hog Rider. The Minion Horde is also effective, but the enemy can Zap them and the Musketeer will one-shot them all. Even if the Musketeer is defeated, the Hog Rider and Valkyrie will have enough time to severely damage the Tower.<br><br>The Hog Rider should be placed behind the Valkyrie to give it a boost so that it stays in front of the Hog Rider, protecting it.<br><br>A Hog Rider combined with a Goblin Barrel can be awkward for the opponent to defend against. Timing it so that the Hog Rider is tanking the tower shots for the Goblins is the most effective way to deal damage. However, a Barbarian Barrel can shut this down with minimal Tower damage for a positive Elixir trade, as long as the Goblin Barrel was placed directly on the Tower.<br><br>Pairing the Hog Rider with the Balloon can deal devastating damage. If executed properly, the Hog Rider will act as a tank while the Balloon threatens to deal massive damage. The Hog Rider can also destroy any buildings attempting to slow down the combo. However, this combo is very vulnerable to swarms and anti-air cards as neither of the troops target anything but buildings. Additionally, they are easy to separate, due to the disparity in move speeds. Alternatively, the Hog Rider and the Balloon can be played in different lanes to spread the opponent&#39;s defenses thin. However, a building or Tornado can bring them back together for an easier defense.<br><br>The Hog Rider can be paired with the Lumberjack as both a swarm bait and damage combo. It is a very fast combo with an extremely high damage output potential, so the enemy will likely try to counter it with a swarm. If this happens, use a spell like Arrows to render the opponent defenseless. If they manage to defeat the Lumberjack, the dropped Rage will make the Hog Rider even more dangerous than it normally is.<br><br>A fast and deadly combination is the Hog Rider and Mini P.E.K.K.A. combo. Both units are fast but the Mini P.E.K.K.A. does much more damage and does not attack only buildings so the Mini P.E.K.K.A. can deal with troops like the Executioner and Musketeer. However, this combo can be defeated with swarms like Skeleton Army, which will defeat both of them since neither of them can deal area damage. They are also unable to target air troops, so the Minion Horde can stop this easily.<br><br>A risky play is to deploy the Hog Rider at the bridge as soon as the match starts. If the opponent does not react fast enough, the Hog Rider will deal a significant amount of damage to the Princess Tower. This can also allow the player to quickly scout the opponent&#39;s deck if they happen to react to him fast enough.
Well that escalated quickly and now to ponder my existence...
You should mention ColdFusion.<br><br>A language that is similar to java but feels like PHP 😂
bro the ending lmaooo
The only thing I know is, I know nothing.
&quot;I´ve got no idea how it works, but it looks cool!&quot; -&gt; My main thought these days XD
ok i am quitting programming
The last 20 Secondsare epic ....&quot;The only thing. I really know is that I know nothing&quot; 😅
I always pronounced MIT (meet)
&quot;Piet&quot; is actually pronounced like &quot;Pete&quot;
v or vlang is a totally fake language dont pay attention to it, memory is deallocated when object is out of scope without further analysis
the two languages i have programmed the most in aren&#39;t even on here: AG Software&#39;s Natural and ABB Robotic&#39;s Rapid.<br><br>Big Sadge :(
you forgot Ć++
And there&#39;s me making C-level algorithms in BASIC

The video ending is so fucked up
I have a philosophy degree and this video is my programming journey in reverse order. I started studying epistemology a over a decade ago and recently discovered Scratch ✌️
I like this Westworld ending 💯
Where&#39;s Perl and WebAssembly !? 😳
Some unmentioned, but very notable languages not mentioned:<br>- Hardware description languages like Verilog and VHDL<br>- Prover languages like Coq, F*, Idris<br>- Model checking languages like Promela, TLA+<br>- Numerical languages like Julia and R
amazing.. 🤯
Walter Bright won&#39;t be happy with this.
I feel like I need a cigarette after watching this video. Good stuff as always!
Thanks for the deep dive
How is possible that binary was invented in the 1600s
Loved the use of a Bollywood movie meme 😆😆 <br>India represent let&#39;s go and also love ur content ❤️
Feeling exurb1a vibes at the end of the video
Pretty sure that&#39;s an Iranian rocket system <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pEfrdAtAmqk&amp;t=695">11:35</a> IRAN LOVE
I want to learn every language now.
There is a Ada, general purpose language named after Ada Lovelace who is generally considered the world&#39;s first computer programmer. It was extremely popular in the 1980s and is still used today by the department of defense to blow people up <br><br>so so sad and funny <br>😂😂😂😂
Definitely, that the logic gates are Minecraft redstones.
fuck , i am done at 11 minute , cant take more ,,,,,
Just wanted to throw it out there because I think it&#39;s such a weird criticism, but in Haskell a monoid is just a type that you can do map on and a monad is just a type you can do flatmap on. For technical reasons that you don&#39;t need to worry about, this enables some syntactic sugar. That&#39;s basically all there is to it.
F# compiles to Javascript also (and soon to Python, Rust &amp; Dart)
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pEfrdAtAmqk&amp;t=804">13:24</a> … it’s pronounced &#39;peet&#39;, not &#39;pee et&#39;. Kind of had to cringe as a Dutch speaker when I heard that mispronunciation 😅
lol<br>impressive
Fireship has single-handedly revived my depression. He has my respect for that 🦀💨
OK. I think learning of math is hard
Fireship made me question life with that ending
This was the best video you’ve done yet😍😂
I really like the ending 🤣 didn&#39;t expected it
I think you should do a more Indepth video on Ada. Rust is a compiler that will whack you round the head if your memory is unsafe, however Ada whacks you round the head when your logic is unsafe. The last thing you want in your military/life critical hardware is for a bug to crop up when you need it to work, especially when you can&#39;t practically test it, such as with a nuke, or doing so may kill someone if things go wrong. Not only does the military use it; railway, infostructure, aviation and medical equipment also still use it today, because of its insistence on making sure your code is logically coherent throughout.
Best programming video on youtube! 😂😄
It&#39;ll be my way. ✊️ I must learn basic, then I&#39;ll learn assembler x86. It&#39;ll be my best CV for Microsoft or Google. Profit
The best!
Delphi! Still using it.
Curses now I&#39;m going down the V rabbit hole. Amazed that such new &amp; promising languages keep popping up.
My head is spinning 😵‍💫
I was shocked when I saw my username randomly pops in this portion <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pEfrdAtAmqk&amp;t=795">13:15</a>
What a good roadmap to venture existential crisis
In the list of esoteric, BhaiLang 🌹
Holy C †
You mentioned scala and closure but not Kotlin as a Java  alternative 🤦🏻‍♂️
Thanks for recommending me a language that&#39;s published in 2025 in a video published in 2022.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pEfrdAtAmqk&amp;t=42">0:42</a> You know s*it is real when you see &quot;DOOM on a toaster&quot; on the top of an iceberg.
The best ending ever :)
Thanks so much for giving the layman breakdown of monads. Never got it before, and now thanks to you I know I never will.

should&#39;ve ended with &quot;I&#39;ll see you in the next one, assuming that either of us exist&quot;
“Please doesn’t do anything, but it makes you a polite programmer” 😂
This went way deeper then anticipated 😳
Amazing overview and absolute savage sarcasm, love it 😂
lol the existential crisis at the end was so jeff moment. <br>this truly was a god-tier tutorial thank you for that.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pEfrdAtAmqk&amp;t=418">6:58</a> -  &quot;C&quot;  should have been drawn on Atlas&#39;s forehead or chest, not in the middle of the world that is being carried.<br><br>Tougher diagram to make, sure. I just feel It&#39;d be more accurate as to what you&#39;re trying to depict.<br>Even so, awesome video and you&#39;re doing a great job making programming more fun with these videos.
At the transistor level you can also use SPICE to &#39;code it&#39;
Was waiting for NewtonScript to float out of the soup....
Bless this channel 😂
lol, I went all the way from basic, through js/python and sql, to c#, c, c++ and rust and then to sol just this year...it took me 20 years. I&#39;am I a god tier lol?)
you must be hating Apple, didn&#39;t include NEXTStep OS, Objective C, Swift
I don&#39;t think I&#39;ve heard Holy C being discussed positively in… well, ever really. Interesting take.

Oh man, I love your sense of humor 😁
No worries, all words he said at the end are also illusions... wait a minUTE... FU-
PowerShell, although very specific, is one of my favorite languages, it&#39;s remotely similar to php and the syntax is very unique
What is knowledge? That&#39;s actually a good question... Specially with all this machine learning algorithms that can &quot;learn&quot; how to resolve an objective...
Lua should probably be deeper on the ice berg, it&#39;s a fairly dead language and metatables can get quite arcane.
suddenly I wanted to try to write a website on a SCRATCH!
In case you were curious, a competent university CS program will take you through most of the layers in this iceberg, except for the esoteric languages. You don&#39;t necessarily need a degree for a job these days, but it does give you most of this knowledge.
I never knew that python was created in the Netherlands :o
Great video! where is MatLab XD
Now I got a video to put my colleagues in high level statically unspoken confusion
Damn Bro
Boo tea full !
You missed Verilog, SystemVerilog at the very bottom level, it is used to program registers and logic gates. I used to be a hardware engineer turning software algorithms into hardware accelerator using Verilog. And now I am writing Javascript React :).
Thank you for the existential crisis at the end there. Really needed it :)
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pEfrdAtAmqk&amp;t=522">8:42</a> here is an explanation of how autofree works:<br><br>- The compiler does &quot;escape analysis&quot; (in quotes, because real escape analysis is a lot more complicated)<br>- For each block: call free on values that do not escape this block.<br>- For all values that may escape and thus cannot be freed: allocate them with boehm GC or do ARC or whatever (on the V website it just says &quot;GC&quot;).<br><br>This reminds me of something... You know, like putting `__attribute__((malloc))` on a C function and having GCC do the escape analysis on my GC object...<br><br>And what essentially <b>every</b> garbage-collected language does for performance...<br><br>But if you say it&#39;s innovative on the website, make the description vague and don&#39;t really say what it is (poorly done escape analysis), you might sucker people into donating.
This will become a mandatory coffee break watch of first lesson of my beginners OOP course. Genius!
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pEfrdAtAmqk&amp;t=736">12:16</a> This is untrue, in INTERCAL the PLEASE keyword does do something. From wikipedia,<br>    If &quot;PLEASE&quot; does not appear often enough, the program is considered insufficiently polite, and the error message says this; if it appears too often, the program could be rejected as excessively polite. Although this feature existed in the original INTERCAL compiler, it was undocumented.
My pet peeve is SQL said as sequel, but I can definitely get behind squeal :D
Pharo 😭😍❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️👏👏👏👍👍👍
onw to learn holy yourself ;)
That&#39;s a lot of language............HOLY SHIT
Basic was the shit.<br>I remember being in school, when we were in a room with computers, exiting win 95 to dos, typing some code, having the internal HP play the song of its people. Apart from one teacher, no body understood what was happening.
I&#39;m sorry for my brain
Eh shoutout to my homeboy and fellow noob engineer Raju <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pEfrdAtAmqk&amp;t=134">2:14</a>.
Absolutely fucking brilliant
Incredible video, I went through a real time travel journey with you 🔥😍
Видео ни о чем.
Was too high for the last part lol
Great video! Can you please  make a video on pros and cons of using statically types and dynamically types languages (more specifically in relation to javascript) ?
wait do people actually pronounce SQL as &quot;squeal&quot;?
visual basic? :D also ... where is rockstar? :D
This is amazing!!! &lt;33 GOSH I LOVE THIS. You explain everything amazingly, your channel is awesome and this is my favorite video from you!! Thank you so much for making this!!
