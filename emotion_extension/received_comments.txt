You have made some mistakes regarding the documentation of C++ in your video. Like it appeared already in 1985 and not 1986 as you showcase in your video. Also it was developed by a Dane and not an American. You even showcase one of his quotes in your video.
I have seen your videos for the first time and they are really good. Thanks for making these.
best programming language is js, and next learn html and css (only for web development) my recommend programming to code is python and Java
I think you missed logic compilers like verilog hdl or vhdl
What about MATLAB?
Machine code is the hardest, but easy if user control is beast. additionally machine code has unli power, but if harness properly it became unstoppable.

I was bewildered in my first year as a junior dev when a grizzled old dev said &quot;don&#39;t tell anybody but I know cobol&quot;, cause I thought it was neat he knew such an old language. But then I found out what it means to know Cobol: they never let you do anything else. You&#39;re too valuable to waste on projects with sexy new programming languages and technologies. Back to the cobol mines maintaining systems as old as your parents. Though in this economy that kind of job security is probably nice.
Back in my day you learned quick basic, pascal, C++, Java, C, Perl, C#, SQL, then html, css and some JS...then PHP, probably some other stuff...oh yeah, IBM Assembly and Motorola Assembly

Just wanna say, after this video i went into a rabbit hole so deep that now i understand binary, know to correlate it with the ascii table and read or write in 0 and 1 in my mind :D     AND  the weirdest part is that we are made of 0 and 1 our genes express or not express, literally.     Its so weird how computers are made in such way that reflect our way of thinking but at the speed of light
Julia can also supposedly cross compile with C, C++, and Python. Julia can function as both a scripting language and a compiled language AFIK.
regarding the philosophical ending and conciseness, I had an epiphany a few days ago. It‚Äôs a bit long but fuck it. <br><br>The philosophical dilemma I have been questioning for many many years, is simple, how can we define what is morally right or wrong. This may seem simple, but it‚Äôs really not. Our sense of right/wrong changes as we age and differs among cultures. A kid first things right/wrong is what their parents decide, then teachers, cops, government, etc. then some people (not all) understand that it‚Äôs very difficult to define what is right/wrong. I know what you‚Äôre thinking, what the hell does this have to do with consciousness, just bear with me.<br><br>Well here‚Äôs my theory. Right/wrong is always determined by the observer performing the action/inaction. As an example, what may be right to me (stealing your food because I‚Äôm starving) may seem wrong to you (someone stole your food, that person is a thief). So who‚Äôs right in this situation from an outside perspective? A reasonable person would ascertain that they both are right and wrong, depending on the perspective. Which is why right/wrong is ALWAYS determined from the observer‚Äôs perspective.<br><br>Now we come to a deeper question, what is the purpose of even designating something as right/wrong? It is a purely ‚Äúhuman‚Äù concept if you think about it. Lower animals just act, a lion doesn‚Äôt care that it ate a baby gazelle, he doesn‚Äôt even have the capacity to question what is right/wrong. His only thought is hungry, eat. This may not seem profound, but it is. The lion performed the action for survival. If you think about it, he did the right thing, had he not hunted he would have starved. He did it because he was hungry. A negative experience is seen as suffering and being a hungry lion is suffering. <br><br>Now we can make another jump, is the reduction of suffering not a survival instinct? We are nothing more than dna, trying to replicate itself. It‚Äôs difficult for us to think of situations in this manner: this will reduce my survival chances/ability to keep my dna alive. We though, instinctively DO have a measuring stick of what does or doesn‚Äôt increase/decrease the survival of our dna and that is our ability to SUFFER. <br><br>People are lazy for the most part and do what is easy. To reduce suffering is easy and people will naturally choose, the reduce suffering option. With this new info, we can make the jump to define what is right/wrong: right is the action/inaction that reduces suffering and wrong is the action that increases suffering (technically, it‚Äôs survival of our DNA, but we use suffering as a measuring stick). <br><br>An animal‚Äôs ability to deduce the likelihood of suffering is directly correlated to their consciousness. In order for an animal to even register suffering, they must have a sense of self. To be conscious of suffering, is to be conscious itself. This is how consciousness came to be. For us to survive, we must be able to comprehend ‚ÄúI‚Äôm in pain, I‚Äôm hungry, etc‚Äù and that requires the formation of identity. The more intelligent the animal, the more capable it is of reducing suffering, and therefore the more conscious it is. <br><br>I know I didn‚Äôt do the best job explaining it, but hopefully I got the point across. This is my own theory that I came up with.<br><br><br>I want to add that this mechanism we use to determine right/wrong is the building block of our societies, cultures, and laws. Think of it as binary, even with just simple 1s and 0s, complex systems can be created. What is right/wrong other than 1s and 0s?

worst thing you can do; is learn multiple languages and not being proficient in any of them. Learn a language that will benefit you until you become advanced, for most software/ai/data all you need is SQL+Python+javascript if you complement it with knowledge in cloud computing and basic bash/linux/devops that&#39;s really all you need today. Don&#39;t waste your time learning other languages only to forget them soon after like I did.

Notice Perl&#39;s logo, but he doesn&#39;t really talk about it? It&#39;s the language that&#39;s everywhere, yet hidden and no one talks about.
Hilariously my college started us with python, then immediately switched to c++ after 1 class and we learned it very well.
Where is Matlab??
Meanwhile me working on verilog
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pEfrdAtAmqk&amp;t=460">7:40</a> funny that whenever c++ is critized, they talk about it like its year 1990. It evolved so much, that nobody uses new/delete anymore but smart pointers. Why the ignorance?
Languages you want to learn: javascript (html and css arent programming languages but learn them), python, sql, lua(for game dev), java (this is a must even if you hate it), c, c++, command line (if you can remotely call this programming) and thats about it.
Another thing. Lua is also found in a Steam Game called Project Zomboid. Y&#39;all should check it out.
QBasic was  my first programming language when I was starting my teens
I studie Informatik and the First Language that we learn was Scratch(First 2 weeks) and Java(Main Language) I like Java Actually. I come from C# and C++ so there were some difficullties but I like it. :)
I don‚Äôt think scratch is even a programming language
Im trying to learn java to get rich on apps. Why not kotlin? Because its too late to go back now.

Bro forgot Lua, it&#39;s weird in it&#39;s own way.
My first code was written in C++, so I&#39;m forever biased towards it.
Damn, I&#39;m superior to all of you (i only know Python)
C has hashmaps, it&#39;s called malloc...
You know what other language also has functions? C!
HTML is NOT a programming language, it&#39;s a markup language!
Nr 1 programming language to learn: C
C++ and Lua is my favorite pair, being able to take advantage of how optimized C++ is but also being able to use some of the nicer features Lua offers because you can add them to each other<br><br>Although that‚Äôs probably not a super popular take, also that kinda comes out of them being the only 2 coding languages I know how to use well

Where does LabView fit?
C/C++ is goated for me
Where does Perl fit in this?
I&#39;m old, so I&#39;ve done Basic, Pascal, Fortran, Cobol, assembly language and even pure machine code on punch cards, but I still find it hard to understand some &quot;modern&quot; terms like &quot;API&quot;. It&#39;s all getting lost in fancy words and equally fancy letter combinations, so you can impress everybody else. &quot;Please do...&quot; I like that.<br><br>Excellent video. Memory Lane.
Dang RPG not even mentioned

Existential crisis jumpscare was out of pocket
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pEfrdAtAmqk&amp;t=917">15:17</a> the transistors used to store bits in the RAM actually consist of 2 or more logic gates and each logic gate consists of 2(NOT gate) or 3(AND and OR gates) transistors. The most basic designs are of ‚Äúflip-flops‚Äù and ‚Äúlatches‚Äù. So saying that the voltage being 0V(for 0) and usually 5V(for 1) in a single transistor represents a single bit is not factually correct as many transistors are involved for representing a single bit.

The only thing I know about computer programming is that I&#39;m pretty sure it&#39;s voodoo black magic. All you programmers really do with your impenetrable secret languages is cast binding spells to summon eldritch demigod beings and force them to use their supernatural powers to make computers work. &quot;Errors in the code&quot; are just when those beings break the binding spell and run amok.
Ocaml is used a lot for compilers not just systems languages
My first language in uni was C/C++ (it was, like, both of them? I mean, they use the same compiler). Don&#39;t know for sure, but I guess the idea is that if you can&#39;t get through it, you shouldn&#39;t waste time on this degree. I kinda understand it, and I worked in it on my first job (they tricked me), but it&#39;s hard, and not in the interesting way

Epistemology is Proverbs 1:7. You&#39;re welcome.
Oh, oh, fun facts about Erlang which I use in my current job:<br>* it&#39;s written in C<br>* but it&#39;s not a C type language, it more resembles functional languages and makes heavy use of pattern matching, and tail call recursion<br>* it does not have loops, it&#39;s recursion or nothing<br>* Erlang is what Elixir is built on! Any Erlang code can be run in Elixir (but you can&#39;t run Elixir in Erlang). If you&#39;re doing Elixir it&#39;s good to learn Erlang so you understand some of the underlying concepts <br>* one of which is death is a 1st class property of the language, due to its nature of being used for telecommunications where transient errors are extremely common, so the language is built around this concept<br><br>I&#39;d definitely reading the free book Learn You Some Erlang For Great Good, it&#39;s one of the best programming books I&#39;ve ever read.

c++ is not hard to learn and nothing will change my opinion.<br><br>i learned c++ when i was 7,5 years old while programming arduinos for fun by looking at the output of ardublocks at first and once i had most of the syntax down i looked through the libraries and learned most of the rest of it like that<br><br>get the first grasp of the language where you can kinda do most of what you want<br>then start a project and implement stuff you don&#39;t know how to implement and ram your way through it by looking up how to do stuff<br><br>if you want to learn how to better make use of the hardware, do all of that on limited hardware, i.e. an arduino uno R3<br>with 32kb of flash, 2048 bytes of ram and a clock of 16mhz, you learn how to make good use of it pretty well

Makes me wonder if developers in India should develop a language ecosystem based on the use of Sanskrit. A Sanskrit based programming language with corresponding keyboards and OS to reach the regular person without English blocking their potential which is the case right now. Their knowledge of Hindi which shares the same characters as Sanskrit would help them catch on quickly. Further Sanskrit already works on a set of strict rules almost like a semi- formal language.

C++ was the first programming language i learned back in high school. I have no idea it&#39;s that difficult lol (i didn&#39;t go too deep into it though)
Don&#39;t forget good ol&#39; Perl. Weirdest syntax I&#39;ve ever seen in a programming language.

after watching this video, i suddenly have the urge to code &quot;myself&quot;
me: fuck where do i even start now........<br>also me: fucking python. its what goog said
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pEfrdAtAmqk&amp;t=750">12:30</a> lmao I can‚Äôt imagine debugging this mess
Wait C++ is a harder language? Why it it the first one my college has people do, bruh (you chose between c++ and java but still) <br>Has me a bit worried as I&#39;m just about the finish my intro to c++ class and while it wasnt bad, I&#39;m not sure how much of those assignment programs I could write on my own (without modifying past code I used). I can tell what each part of the code does when I look at it but remembering to structure that way seems like it will be a challenge.<br>Anyone have any pointers on how to do help me do that?

Glad to hear that Java is a disaster for beginners. It was the first language I had to learn for a engineering project (other than some middle school level html) and completely turned me away from ever doing programing again.

‚ù§Ô∏èüïäBecause God so loved the world that he gave his only Son, so that whoever believes in him may not perish, but have eternal life.  I am making known to you brothers, the Gospel that God gave us and through which we are saved if we keep His word.  Jesus Christ died for our sins, was buried and rose again on the third day according to the scriptures, that He appeared to Cephas then to the twelve, after which He appeared to more than 500 brothers at once.  Afterwards He appeared to Jacob, then to all the apostles.   Jesus ascended to heaven and sits at the right hand of God the Father and will return a second time to judge us the living and then the dead.  We have to change the way we think and the way we live our lives, that is to say brothers in a word we have to repent.   Make no mistake, bad company spoils good habits.  Come to your senses and do not sin!  For there are some of you who do not know God.<br><br>God will judge us according to the 10 commandments, if we have broken even one of these then we must pay the debt by death, BUT JESUS ‚Äã‚ÄãPAID IN OUR PLACE, we must keep His commandments, but even if we sin by mistake then we repent,  we stand up and apologize to the Father through Jesus and our sins will be forgiven, God loves us very much even if we don&#39;t want to‚ù§Ô∏èüïä

ok now I&#39;m high<br>give me more
Brainfuck :)
in my opinion pascal is the best lang to start (for understanding the logic of programming)! obviously i was complaining ab it (oh it&#39;s too hard(ps for begginer)/nobody uses it now) but! when i start studying learning my second lang (c++) it felt like i dont need to learn all theory again, only the syntax and oop. An oak is not felled at one stroke!
It&#39;s not Pi-jet Mondriaan. You&#39;d be much closer pronouncing it as &quot;Pete Mondriaan&quot;. &#39;ie&#39; is pronounced as one vowel in Dutch

now i have a trauma
just don&#39;t learn NLP (Natural Language Programming) documentation searches is a confusing maze. You might find yourself dealing with NLPP (Natural Language Programming Practices) and NLLP (Normalized Language Logic Protocols), which often lead to NNLP (Non-Linear Narrative Patterns) in the emerging AI languages programming...and that&#39;s why hallucinations exists.
C and C++ are high-level languages.
I&#39;m just gonna hold onto learning C++ and hope that&#39;s enough for now
If someone says &quot;high level languages like C&quot; you are cooked
You missed the languages to code FPGAs like Verilog or VHDL

I only know python, so none of this applied to me lol. Cause unreal and blender use that so like I&#39;m good, I don&#39;t even know the language well, I got a python for dummies book, not that I really use it I do visual coding, although it might be easier to hard code it but then again that means difficult. Idk I been on the game dev journey for I guess not as long as game design but still over a decade and I got squat to show for it cause I fried three computers, so yeah like in highschool all my friends knew coding and I was like lets make a game but I was the only one that was putting in work on the visuals and then they&#39;d pitch ideas and I had to manage, and then I decided to live my life away from videogames and pretend I have the sanity score for being a writer or the gusto to be a tattoo artist, and I can&#39;t keep a beat, I keep mixing it up so I sold my drumset twice. Idk let me finish all the youtube tabs I have open, it&#39;s a big deal to me to be building a world i might wanna live in. I do still have people my brother graduated with to pitch in when I get stuck I&#39;m just scared of getting stuck.

The only thing I disagree with is codeing in basic. Don&#39;t waste your time, Scratch is good, but basic is so old I can see dust around,

Autism comments below ^^<br>- Python will always be blasphemy in my eyes, no matter how popular it gets, i need those brackets and semicolons..

And this is why it pays to learn Compiler Theory and language workbenches: so you can invent new compilers to compile new languages whenever your current language breaks or causes a hint of jealousy or inadequacy. Then you&#39;ll forever be working on the perfect language that will probably never be, just like Charles Babbage in his day.
The most interesting part was the comment at the end....and certainly, God exists.

In reality it&#39;s not like suggested at @<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pEfrdAtAmqk&amp;t=130">02:10</a>. You can&#39;t chose to stop learning even if you want to. The company will make you go deeper whenever there&#39;s some business to grab that will requires it. I started writing C drivers for IoT equipment at a very small startup and now I&#39;m doing fullstack / devops for a large Japanese group using mainly Python, React, Docker and Kubernetes.

Great ride. When you went down to the transistor/gate level I thought you might mention hardware description languages like Verily or VHDL. It also reminded me of this quote by a computer hardware pioneer: &quot;There are a surprising number of people who program day-by-day but don‚Äôt actually understand how a computer works. That limits you. It‚Äôs important to have a fairly good idea of what goes on at the bottom. Cutting it off at the C compiler seems to me to be quite limiting.&quot; (Charles Thacker, 2012)

Rust?
Yes, R is used in data science, but so is Python.  There is a fair argument that Python is more scalable partly because it&#39;s a general-purpose scripting language.  Some libraries take pythonic code and recompile it using C before executing it.  This is particularly useful for deep learning.<br><br>I had previously dismissed Python as a sort of toy or hobby language, but it&#39;s turned out to be far more advanced than I had realized.

My first language to learn was MS BASIC, at school early 90s üòÖ
I&#39;m new to coding and I&#39;m jumpting directly into C#. Should I be worried?
For beginners:<br>Start learning a C type language ( they are not that easy but very good for learning the basics ). I would prefer C# ( I just hate it less ). After you started learning it just a little bit yeet that bitch the heck out of your life and never touch C type languages again. You will live a happy life
I&#39;ve only learnt to code in WTF+- language, which is a God level programming interface solely used by my brain, which compiles fragments of applets aiming at having me trying to figure out &quot;What the heck am I watching?&quot; everytime I get lost in the Ytb Styx .<br><br>You might wonder why it&#39;s not been called the WTH+- , &amp; actually, it should&#39;ve, but by accident (some random electron migration through the synaptic connections in my neuronal deep learning engine) the authentification key of the 1st occurrence of the language in the official list of available cryptographic interfaces between neuronal fields hardware (i.e. the Cerebral Personal Unit, CPU) &amp; the software (i.e. the Mind), was corrupted, but smh outputed a string instead of a blatant error msg, with 1 character change: the H . Researchers at the time couldn&#39;t figure out how that was possible, some speculated a hidden mechanism of &quot;bluffing back-testing preservation algorithm&quot; that would lead the whole code to output the most coherent answer, despite some minor error in the pipeline, as long as it was small enough to not obfuscate the whole signal.<br>It ended up being called the WTF+- , owing to the fact most opinions on it were so balanced on their controversy, they wanted to symbolically highlight it in a memorable yet obvious way.<br><br>Aside of all those tumultuous episodes leading to that creation, I now became a specialist in that language, &amp; wrote several prgm from it, notably the famous Procrastinate.brainrot , which when executed, gets you to write the most useless &amp; obnoxiously time-wasting paragraphs , that have a tendency to lead their readers to complete inefficiency while they&#39;re doing it.<br>In other words, it&#39;s a PUP (Potentially Unwanted Prgm) but it took time to realize it, so don&#39;t be too pressed to blame me on it. At 1st, it was designed to get ppl&#39;s NDLE (neuronal deep learning engine) to surpass itself, through some disruptive pathways they couldn&#39;t conceptualize before.<br><br>So then I had to find a fix for that newly discovered malware, so I edited ThisCommentIsSponsoredByRedShadowLegend.brainrot ... nah that&#39;s the old version, ppl said it was an adware, can&#39;t figure out why... It&#39;s ThisDoesRunCrysis.Rust , that was designed to be compatible with the Rust ecosystem, &amp; it basically preserves the benefits of Procrastinate, but alleviates the cons . <br><br>Now, thx to that fix, I&#39;m able to manage my time much better, &amp; I can&#39;t remember the last time I actually got myself lost on Ytb, watching stuff I couldn&#39;t even start to understand...<br><br><br><br>Unless the soft had a backdoor since the beginning, &amp; actually I&#39;d&#39;ve been running some neuro-cryptominers in the subconscious background, which would&#39;ve involved most of my CPU&#39;s ressources, in something other than my own goal accomplishments... Wait .  I need to check there wasn&#39;t any SSH injection into the JS emulated buffer, that would be a critical vulnerability that the NSA could use to social engineer me &amp; potentially regain a bit of their lost capital with their xz breach that got busted ... I&#39;llBB .
No love for XQuery.  :(
on my  way to learn cobol
As a teenager I couldn‚Äôt justify the expense of getting an Assembler for my Z80 computer, so I wrote my low-level subroutines in machine code.
so ur final suggestion is to stick to JS??
in the end, madness takes over thank you ^_^
Good my latest Intel CPU was i5 6600k :D<br>now and forever i&#39;m gonna buy Ryzen.
please stop blaspheming, leave God out of your video if you won&#39;t bring Him in with His due respect
I missed FORTH in the video, a stack-based language with very simple primitives.  Epson used it to develop their QX-10 desktop machines (via Rising Star and its ValDocs office suite). Which is to say FORTH was actually very powerful and fast, given what it drove the hardware to do.
Just seeing Dr.Racket and Simula in your thumbnail gave me a fucking PTSD episode.
watch this at 1.5x ur be dead soon ! ALL the Best
Faaaak
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pEfrdAtAmqk&amp;t=214">3:34</a> You have given the origin and time of every language. I loved that!
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pEfrdAtAmqk&amp;t=136">2:16</a> You literally used a meme taking image from the infamous movie from India by India &quot;3 Idiots&quot;  !
One more layer: chemistry and physics so you can DIY transistors from sand or quantum computer from weird materials
Today i come to know the Sh!t i used in 6th class for fun was a Language Scratch was scrap fr
Fortunately i only need to know C and rest is domain knowledge üôÇ. Working as a Nos developer was a god send even if the pay is crap
I miss the person I was 15 minutes ago
Weren&#39;t curly braces actualy ALGOL&#39;s stuff rather then c&#39;s?
When I just started Embedded development, I started from C++, than I was have to move to C, since in Embedded it‚Äôs more optimized taking less ram and gives more stability. But than I was fool and because of greedy, I went to the well paid project with a lot of logic on asm. Since it‚Äôs old project and it‚Äôs have extremely limited space and cpu usage. Already like 3 years working with this asm. More than 36 burned down cpu, from developing kits, already have some problems with alcohol, my wife just left, my social problems raised up dramatically. Walls in apartment become best IDE. And Jesus Christ, I love ASM with all of my heart, I would never ever return back to the any high level. When your heart beat goes in the same ticks as your cpu, when you just feel this chemistry and electricity, when you touch her send body. It‚Äôs smt. And I‚Äôm only 30 and probably stuck in low level forever. So true story, highly recommend not dig in to it. There no future and you would never ever return back to high level
I wouldn&#39;t put Rust so low in the iceberg. It&#39;s much more high-level than people think it is, while also being very low-level, allowing you to easily write complex servers, etc.
now i see computers completely differently
So basically me learning c++ will eventually lead to singularity... Interesting
what is bro yapping about üó£üó£üó£üó£
i learnt programming by reading a book about building a cpu. so yes, i did start from the very bottom of the iceburg. btw the book is called &quot;Code&quot; by charles petzold

Honestly, I don&#39;t think the lower levels are that difficult to grasp. Currently at work I am analyzing the behavior of a micro-controller&#39;s registers, to implement some algorithms to detect cross-talk between memory cells etc. and it&#39;s essentially just moving some bits around and checking what happens with nearby bits inside the hardware. (IEC class C safety stuff) It&#39;s also ridiculously fun to do in my opinion lol I think every software/firmware engineer should learn a thing or two about how a processor works internally.
Welp just started how to learn code and this helps boost my confidence<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>in the opposite direction though
I wrote my first lines of code in assembly.
no matlab or igor
Let&#39;s cut to the chase: if you can do C (and I mean <b><i>really</i></b> do C) everything else is just a couple of hours&#39; learning the fluff on a wet Wednesday afternoon...
after following this road map @sigma
Honestly i find java quite readable<br>It might be due to the fact that my first programming language was java

Cancel me all you want. HTML is <b>not</b> a programming language kids.
I have worked 14 years with html and from where I stand it&#39;s not a proper programming language.<br>but I didn&#39;t really do any development nor did I ever learn any more html then what I used on a daily basis, which wasn&#39;t much...<br>So i may be underqualified to judge after 14 years experience ^^D<br><br>Also: nobody even mentions &quot;Delphi&quot;, C&#39;s ugly inbred cousin.<br>Instead we get an almost 5 minute long excursion in programming languages from hell... not complaining... just processing what i have just been confronted with.
Excellent overview of many languages I had heard of, but never had the opportunity to dive into.  However, I&#39;m bummed.. you missed two of my favorite esoteric languages... Forth and PostScript (a proper superset of Forth).  I spend roughly 15 years as a PostScript programmer/debugger dealing with multi-gigabyte .PS files.  Great times.

That please syntax in inter cal got me, they should&#39;ve add that in modern proglang
Very useful and interesting video, can&#39;t stop watching this video, watched like 4 times so far, sometimes with friends.
I like how the lowest level is philosophy
I‚Äôve been wanting to learn how to program for like 2 years now and I have barely touched any programs out of school, I just watch lots of vidoes on it hoping I pick it up
Real programmers write in machine code, directly in notepad üòÇ
Finally a roadmap for my life thnx
i litrally got a storke at the end of the video
You forgot the boomer language. Yell at your kids until the computer does what you want.
Bro forgot to mention &quot;minecraft redstone&quot; in the lowest tier.
Am I a top mind if I understand the hat he‚Äôs saying
You forgot to add micromolecular programming, and string subspace programming, also don&#39;t forget the 4th dimension trinary language.
the hard &quot;s&quot;
I need an iceberg to explain half the words used. Knowing nothing about programming also means I don&#39;t know words and their contexts here like &quot;functional&quot; and &quot;object oriented&quot;.
Started at programming, ended at an existential crisis of all identity and knowledge... Tracks!
You hack me
Cool!!!! Thanks. I want to learn C. so i will continue!
Why did bro have to hit us with that existential crisis core at the closing
fuck it ill write another doom program with a ton of logic gates on a breadboard.
Late comment. but GML is a G.O.A.T.
Real of JavaScript know only their programmers he easy but that you do big project this easy language becomes hard
All i did was ctrl A ,shift tab to my friend as a joke an now i am alone forever py is great
Is C# a good starting point for an absolute newbie?
JS is the worst beginner language. Nope. Do python instead.
i have start with c++
You guys think if i ask Jesus to give me knowledge on programming i could avoid all the suffering? Python already tough i am NOT prepared bro üíÄ

Now I think I would be interested in watching a YouTube video of someone learning one hard programming language from each group from top to bottom
HTML is not a coding language
Useless now. DO NOT PURSUE THIS. AI WILL RUIN YOU.
Where&#39;s MatLab?
Doesn&#39;t Objective C deserve a mention? It might be old compared to Swift but it&#39;s still used in a lot of Apple Mac and iOS apps.
I dont know dude but r u high?
I&#39;ve always made the assumption that HTML and CSS were not programming languages, but we&#39;re rather markup languages, kind of like if you remember learning in elementary or junior high school or whatever how to diagram sentences to understand grammatical structure.

Okh now I am having motivations to learn every faking thing in the ice berg
Holy C was amazingly . . . Bad. And funny. üòÇ
we had assembly in the previous sem at the end they told us we have a lab exam and no one even tried to learn it for the exam
my first programming language was scratch, then went to C++ then went to Assembly. that&#39;s the amount of brainf0ck u get here in italy.
My history with learning programming is weird by the standards of this iceberg:<br><br>My first taste, and what got me into it, was an elective C++ course at my high school, so I &quot;grew up&quot; as a programmer taking pointers and manual memory management for granted, especially because my first courses in Software Engineering also used C++.<br><br>The second language I learned was Assembly, because it was used to teach Processor Architecture. It was a bit clunky at first, but they never asked me to do anything super complicated with it.<br><br>Then came SQL, Javascript, CSS, and PHP for the subjects of Databases and Web Developement respectively. Of these, CSS was the one which gave me most trouble.<br><br>Then I tried to take an elective in Advanced Programming, which required me to learn Java. Despit it supposedly being user friendly, I struggled a lot with it. Luckily my next subject was Algorithms and Data Structures, which borught back my beloved C++.<br><br>Around this time, I started getting into Gamedev with Unity, so I started learning C#, which as someone fluent in C++ was a breeze.<br><br>I am currently studying Bash for the project for my Operating Systems exam, and trying to wrap my head around the absolute clusterfuck that is trying to code in Unreal Engine; I never thought my dear C++ could betray me so, and yet I have yet to manage making a simple chess game respond to me pressing keyboard keys.

Perl doesn&#39;t even get a mention üò≠
Starting with binary octal and hexadecimal and assorted conversion methods then basic logic functions, logic gates, karnaugh tables etc, how to make an adder &amp; a 7 segment display should be mandatory steps for anyone trying to be a programmer and would avoid many problems down the line.
there are peoples out there who respect God so u can just make without doing that u don&#39;t have to do the way u did

No need to blasphemy in your content! Please remove it and repent.
lol the ending. thank you for illustrating that everything that has to do with knowledge ends in philosophy.
never seen a computer video ends up with philosophy
INTERCAL actually requires the use of the keyword PLEASE or else the compiler will reject it for being rude, however you also cannot use PLEASE too much or else the compiler will reject it for being overly polite.
Made my own programming launguage which uses all of those in one and all i can say is it is really, really hard to learn like I swear it is like completely crazy.
I genuinely don&#39;t understand &quot;Normal&quot; languages, I started on 6502 assembly, my goal was making a simple game that could run on a NES, I started on assembly and TRIED to learn other languages, but I just can&#39;t seem to get some stuff, for me, that assembly is so basic, makes it more logical, like &quot;Oh this goes here that goes to that address in memory&quot;, its more logical and therefore, in my opinion, easier
Mentioning Solidity and not CUDA is a little crazy. Solidity is a domain-specific language ‚Ä¶ if you want to go there then CUDA is a far more influential one that is the de facto language behind the AI revolution. Surely there is space for CUDA in the ‚Äúiceberg‚Äù??
SQL is turing complete?
My professional language (ABAP) again safely forgotten.

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pEfrdAtAmqk&amp;t=935">15:35</a> You forgot RTL (Logic gate programming) languages like Verilog and VHDL -BRO!
dang it, i was hoping you were going to mention qbasic.
Shame on you for not including Forth! Widely used for astronomical equipment and lab instrumentation. Rockwell made a silicon chip that directly executes Forth words as its machine instructions. It inspired other stack oriented languages such as STOIC and PISTOL.
I know nothing lol
Bruh my first language is C. üíÄ
There is no such thing as &quot;preferred&quot; programming language. We just hate some less than others.
bro my uni here in algeria tought us C as our first ever language to learn
Next video should be on explaining Entropy.
Kotlin was invented in Russia, not Czechia.
Scratch makes me wanna... I can&#39;t say that
Hmh, guess I should learn straight for logic gates. Why even borther learning high level langangues if you can maximzise your potential right from the get go lol.<br><br><br>I chose C# in the hopes of never needing to lern somthing else. Maye C++ but only the basics so I can use the blueprint system in Unreal. I love programming but I hate learning it.

both of my parents are COBOL programmers for Bank of America, almost all of the programmers in the departments that use COBOL are in their 50&#39;s and 60&#39;s. he&#39;s not lying when he says learn COBOL if you want to make money. banks will almost hire you immediately if you know COBOL because it would be too difficult and expensive for them to change the source code of the systems they have that use it.

Nice, very accurate reviewüéâ <br>I‚Äôm a senior dev &amp; what can I suggest is to not try learn &amp; track all the new libs, frameworks and tools on the market. just learn few core stuff, like React + Node, or Py + Django, thats it, you‚Äôll get to the point that you have to know more by the way of a dev process if it becomes necessary, no need to learn that all stuff in advance‚Ä¶
thanks a lot, brother

Python does use curly brackets. Example:<br><br>x = float(input(&quot;What is x? &quot;))<br>y = float(input(&quot;What is y? &quot;))<br>print(round(f&quot;{(x + y):,}&quot;, 2))<br><br>Python uses curly brackets mainly for 2 purposes:<br>1. Dictionary Data Type: Curly brackets are used to define dictionaries, which are a collection of key-value pairs. <br>2. Set Data Type: Curly brackets can also be used to define sets, which are an unordered collection of unique elements.<br><br>Or as in my own example above they can also be used within a formatted string (f-string) to indicate where the value of a variable should be inserted.

You forgot one language: genetic code<br>You can use it to literally program working molecules into existence. And you can only choose from 4 letters when writing it.
nice that you put epistomology at the end XD
assembly is my beautiful wife that hits me and i let her. javascript is a stranger breaking into my house and attempting my life on the regular
Developers, honestly, are you happy you continued with the path or do you regret how much you have invested in going down the developer path? I curious since I dropped out and didn&#39;t go back, with reasons not dropping out not being due to the field per se.
I should have never watched this video haha
Thx for the video. It was real to me! üëç
I love watching this, remembering how I startet with c++. Good times
Still thanking my teacher for letting us see and learn assembly even if a little, not because it&#39;s useful, just for the fact I can tell people &quot;yeh but I can program a calculator in assembly&quot;.
Where is my india
My starting language was actualy C++ combined with C and a bit of x86 asm
C# is the most versatile language that can be used for anything. Build web applications, apps, desktop applications, console, games... But you should also know javascript since every browser has it built in and basic understanding of CSS and HTML. Probably a good idea to know SQL as well.
I clicked on this video just to say I&#39;m dissapointed that python wasnt on the thumbnail
Data Structures + Algorithms = Program. Master these.
Wow, man. The JS&#39;s syntax is ugly??üòÇ
How in the fuck do you think basic belongs on the same tier as scratch??? Why are all programming tier lists put together by non-programmers?
In the end its just 0s and 1s.<br>with other 0s and 1s.
I&#39;m learning C. I spent the last 2 days trying to figure out how to get a compiler to work<br><br>God help me
You didn&#39;t spend enough time on nim, the greatest programming language of all time. Makes me cry inside.
C++ is God! Everything else is shit!
This is crazy
Surprised you didn‚Äôt mention Uniface.
The biggest programming language of all times: Philosophy
Excellent summary of a confusing landscape.
The ending to this video obviously deserved a like. LMAO
The problem with Java isn&#39;t the syntax, it&#39;s the garbage collection method of memory management.  This results in periodic pauses in execution and is also very wasteful of memory resources in multitasking environments which is to say ALL modern environments.

Electrical engineers: Wait? Why is the iceberg the other way around?!
Wait, Rust is prefered by the modern chad more than c and cpp???
Well, I don&#39;t regret having learned to program in Pascal, Basic, Fox Pro and C++ back in 2001. Fun times...
That was the coolest ending ever
For me this was the 2nd last nail in the coffin. Commenting after a month I watched this video. Yeah! Programming is over for me. I guess it was not my cup of tea after all.
Whell html is more of a layout language ( think postscript/latex) byr rge combination of html and js well the programming part is really  js but never mind.
M8 i need serious help with my c# project, i need to make a recipe rating website but bruuuhhhh i can&#39;t do shit with the databaseüò≠
I learned to program with assembly
saying scratch is a programming language is like saying taco bell is authentic mexican food
I fucking like this guy, what an outro
One thing always to remember. What you want to achieve as an end result will determine the language you use. What is not mentioned in this great video is the amount of memory you require to run the code.
Thank you for this video,now my braincells are all burnt up
What the actual fuck
You ever seen a webserver implemented in a database? I&#39;ve seen a webserver implemented in a DB...<br><br>You ever seen someone implement 100% of an application config in SQL? You ever seen a dev spend a month wrapping a Haskel app in Electron? Why Haskel bro, why. I think about that guy a lot.

Kotlin came from Russia, not Czechia
When I started working in IT, colleagues recommended I learn Python as my first language. I went through a thick book titled &quot;Learn Python in 24 hours&quot; (spoiler; it took closer to 2 months to work through). I made two scripts that worked well, then I run out of applications for it. Now armed with some context to coding terminology, I started learning PowerShell. <br><br>It was a game changer; I made CLI and GUI tools for simplifying complex tasks, scripts that glued services together, and automated various tasks. It also opened up the vastness that is Azure and Office 365, which only offer maybe 40% of their features and settings via GUI. <br><br>My latest project is a program that can run and manage multiple stopwatches, which I needed as I work on multiple tasks throughout the day. It started small, and it grew to have a limit of 18 quintillion stopwatches, Cisco-style user input, autorefresh and sorting, and soon it will be able to handle multiple commands at once. <br>Is it overkill? Absolutely, it reached absurd levels of complexity long ago. But do I have fun? Hell yeah.

HTML and CSS my beloved.
&quot;html and css combined together are turing complete&quot;??? ... wow, do you even know what &quot;turing completeness&quot; means? you got it all wrong, you will be cancelled by anyone who made it through a first semester of cs if claiming that html and css are programming languages.<br>You cannot even compute 1+1 with html and css only, let alone &quot;compute everything that is computable&quot; - which is what &quot;turing completeness&quot; means.
Hi.can somebody answer my question:<br>Im new to programming and i am learning python for coding it&#39;s better to code in visual code studio or pycharm?
You can actually program in logic gates using verilog or vhdl hardware description languages. They also have procedural functionalities so you can test those gates

I&#39;d rather program in a weird fun language than f,ucking Rust or Javascript.
Rust is overrated and stupid. It will never replace C++.
Charles Babbage was the first programmer.
Elixir is just Erlang with worse syntax. Erlang is much more relevant and modern than Elixir. You messed up the placement.

Never in a million year did I expect to have some philosophy talk in this channel, but what is life without surprises?
Been programming on C, C++, C# and Java for past 5 years. Had some nasty encounters with Python and JS and for the life of me can‚Äôt stand them. The syntax is so messy, everything is so ambiguous. I‚Äôm so angry that people can find jobs by simply learning one of those yet it is practically impossible for me to learn and master
Uh...
surprised to not see ahk on here
This video should get more views
This is not the roadmap video this video is about how many languages there are and the ranking of them üëéüèª
This video is so much fun! You forgot vhdl and verilog.
ive done c++ python javascript html/css  am i safe??
Incredible resource for learning programming. Really helped me grasp the basics.
Very cool video, thank you!
This was a wild ride. I&#39;ve dabbled in programming a few times and recently decided to take a deep dive and go back to college for computer science. I have four five week classes coming up on Python, JavaScript, C++ (which I learned a bit in college 20 years ago), and SQL. Pretty damned excited, honestly. I can&#39;t wait to get to a point where I can feel comfortable playing around with some of the more obscure languages.
I use bluprint in UE4/5 does that mean I know c++?
Also in college, I remember at least a handful of students that wanted to get into programming but struggled with basic concepts because their mind just wasn&#39;t wired that way. It was obvious that they lacked the natural talent required to be a professional programmer. When going into a CS interview there will be no AI support and candidates will be asked a series escalating coding problems to determine their knowledge and skills. Imaging being asked to code a Mandelbrot algorithm on a white board as the first coding question, and then asked how it can be optimized. Canidates can&#39;t BS there way through a technical interview. They can, or they can&#39;t solve the problem. But, depending on the complexity of the problem, getting close can be OK. Never give up solving it until asked to stop. Need to be a dog that is obsessed with a bone. They want to see if a candidate gives up on solving a coding problem that has becomes become difficult.
isn&#39;t javascript a scripting language?

Well at my uni they simply dumped to you a ton of languages and you had to deal with it somehow (SQL, C, C++, C#, JS, html, css, sql, Python, assembly, lisp, bison, Java) then working I only learnt Typescript and IaC

Coding is likely just too complicated and will need to be simplified via AI to make it as user friendly, accessible as possible. In the future, programming may be more of a creative field using VR headsets rather than reading lines of text. ü§î
No way someone actually mentioned LISP. I use it in my drafting software AutoCAD. it can be used to write custom commands and processes in the software, very fun stuff.
Fantastic review!
I started with The Cs, C#, C++ and C for game development.
For a sales and operations guy like me, VBA would be the top. I&#39;m guessing VBA is not counted as a programming language lol.

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pEfrdAtAmqk&amp;t=119">1:59</a> This is the programming language you will ever need as a front end developer, that is JS and maybe also TS.
C  &gt;  python
Ah yes, a great video that starts with a how-to-code language made for kids and beginners and ends with existential crisis. Pleased to say that I have quit programming and have started philosophy.
You forgot coding with eternal all/nothingness
Java is unbelievably frustrating with its extremely long syntax and stupid camel casing and oop Obsession
I&#39;m a Primary School student and the <a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23learntocode">#LEARNTOCODE</a> languages(we had to use them in a P2 activity) actually suck. maybe it was because now i&#39;m already writing my own code in Python and Bash
And this is why... I&#39;ll always have a job, thanks for confirming!
This inspired me to Become The Best and Very Profitable and Desired Programer
I hate JavaScript, far more confortable with C or Python and spent many months learning Django for my web portfolio.Eventually gave up and went with the tried and tested holy trinity (HTML,CSS,JS) and oh boy it was a dumpster fire!

Visual Basic 6 was my start down the path. Some BASIC before that. Then PHP with the rise of the internet, and a dip in Pascal. Then Visual C#, and Javascript. <br><br>Kinda stuck at this point.

After that video i dont feel so bad anymore with my C, C++ and Assembly skills
Absolutely love the ending. That&#39;s why I&#39;m subscribed.
Well done, but you missed the mark on that last one. It should have been biological coding, ie programming in DNA. We are barely scratching the surface in that field, and yet it&#39;s the field of life itself.

Nice cable guy reference!
I hate it that I know every language before Esoteric. I did a module in UNI called programming language concepts where they showed how a programming concept is implemented across all languages. Up to a point where we were implementing Records across all OO languages and and representation of classes in functional languages. They almost even convinced us that all of this can be done in HTML, most of us hit the pause button at that point.
You missed VHDL and Verilog‚Ä¶
You forgot the best one of them all.... TI
The fun part is that I understand everything down to C before then blanking out completely until we arrive at assembly which is something I understand again, machine code, hardware design on the transistor level, all easy, and then we do quantum stuff and I blank out again.
You should start from.. <b>scratch</b> ü§≠
As a bystander i do not understand, why is there a need for so many languages in the first place? why isnt there a single &quot;meta&quot; programming language that everyone is agreed on to use?
I didn&#39;t watch the video yet but this thumb is fking exaggerated<br>Ppl gonna be afraid of learning programming by this<br>It&#39;s not like that, eventually you&#39;ll learn part of those and some it&#39;s not a matter of learn at all.

If [C and C++ are low-level part of the Ice-mountain] then ASM is binary?<br>And later claims [Fortran was first High-level before C came], where if [C is high level] then C++ and Python are Alian-technology-level.

But html is not a programming language
Years ago in highschool in my electronics class I made a version of a Pong game with a PIC16 microprocessor (if I remember the IC) and other various parts while everyone was making LEDs flash or making a tiny speaker beep, sure it wasn&#39;t exactly solely using transistors but hell I was soo excited the first time seeing it boot up and it ran. Only issues were that one of the buttons were broken and I had no replacement and the teach keep my project in the end.

What if I make my own programming language that slaps all of that? (Is a joke)
as a kid I desperately wanted a laptop, In the mid to late 90‚Äôs laptops were the coolest thing in the world to me: the holy grail. I used to take big books and flip up the back cover and draw a keyboard on the last page and pretend I had a laptop lol. One day my Dad brought home a laptop he snagged from work that wouldn‚Äôt boot into Windows anymore. I sat and messed with this thing 24/7. I could use it in DOS and eventually I discovered a little gem called Qbasic which was installed on there. That basically consumed me from age 9-13. I wasted so much time trying to create ambitious projects in Qbasic. I was basically self taught through analyzing the few sample programs it came with like snake, the gorilla game, and some kind of rudimentary money manager program. It was a very exciting time and I often wonder what would have happened if I stuck with coding and tinkering with computers. Now I don‚Äôt know what the hell is going on. I know some basic Python and that is about it.
Pascal! man I miss coding in that. In high school we started in scratch for a semester, then spent the next year coding in pascal.

Very good job, thank you for your time and effort. The only but I would like to express is about lack of several languages in the bottom part. You didn&#39;t mentioned any of hardware languages such as vhdl, verilog or systemC. There are also some others, but those 3 are major

Please carry on doing all of the hard work you do in order to make such awesome videos! Loads of love and support from me!
To anyone trying to learn programming from the beginning, my best advice is to just pick a language that you like at first glance. Stop stressing over what language you need to start with, because the most important skill of all is to begin to think like a programmer. You will never have as much of a challenge learning a language as you do your first one. And no specific language is going to make it that much easier because you are training your brain to think in a way that is fairly alien to the way most of us go about our day to day lives. But once it <b>clicks</b> and you begin to think like a programmer, you can pick up and become functional in another language in a week or sometimes even just a weekend. You just need to first get used to breaking problems down and solving them with basic yes/no questions and then you are on your way
Your video proves there&#39;s a self-punishing trait on those who pursue programming.<br>Thank you for enlightening what my psychiatrist said.

The year is 2100. We finally implemented the perfect replacement to C that interop with C, C++, Rust, Carbon... and etc.
A friend of mine who went into coding several years back told me an interesting tale:<br><br>The whole class was tasked with creating a computer virus each, which would be uploaded to an isolated hard drive to see what happens.<br><br>One dude wrote his virus entirely in assembly, which no one else in class was willing to do. <br><br>Once uploaded, the hard drive started humming loudly, and after a few moments, the most horrible screeching sound filled the entire classroom, and the test computer with isolated hard drive completely shut down. Nothing on it worked anymore, and if I remember the tale right, turning the computer on again simply wasn&#39;t happening. <br><br>When the professor asked the student what he did exactly, the student explained how he programmed the assembly virus to spin the hard drive way past the safe limit (not sure how fast, but my friend was adamant that the spin alone was enough to do serious damage), and then made the hard drive spin BACKWARDS, utterly destroying the hard drive in the process. <br><br>Not long after, some government representatives came by to talk to this dude, and my friend says no one saw or heard from him ever again. He suspects the dude landed a very high-profile government job by completely destroying a hard drive using assembly.

My man went from programming language staircase to straight up philosophy
C language stands for chad language
You&#39;re wrong dude. You start programming by learning a hardware near mid-high level programming language like C/C++, then later when you get a job you either use that, or use one of the simpler even higher level ones like Python, or you go for the deep dive and learn Cobol or lower level languages, all the way down to assembly, for specialized jobs.

Damn, so I started at the bottom of the iceberg.

I‚Äôm a C++ developer and I think C++ isn‚Äôt too hard to learn. But setting up everything including C++ libraries is absolutely painful.

Searching up tutorials, following them bit by bit making sure everything is perfect but I still get errors. If I can‚Äôt setup SFML by February, I may consider learning java script and stick with building console applications with C++

Kinda out of context<br><br>I would like anyone to give insights on whether it&#39;s worth it to get the &#39;Java SE 8 Programmer I (associate)  | 1Z0-808&#39;, followed by &#39;Java SE 8 Programmer II (pro) | 1Z0-809&#39; certifications. It&#39;s almost 2024 now and Java 17 has been released already. In this option, I&#39;d have to take both exams to get the pro badge<br><br>or just go for &#39;Java SE 11 Developer | 1Z0-819(professional)&#39; , which is just one exam<br><br>or the &#39;Java SE 17 Developer | 1Z0-829&#39;(professional), also one exam<br><br>Been programming in Java for about 2yrs now and I feel confident that I will make it through the &#39;1Z0-809 (assoc)&#39; exam but that means I&#39;ll have to pay twice (assoc and pro exam), which is a bit costly. Sitting for the pro exams ((1Z0-819 or 1Z0-829) from the get-go, without an assoc cred) is kinda intimidating. keep in mind that I&#39;m also considering the versions of Java, that the exams test knowledge on. <br><br>What would you go for? Is it a great idea to sit for the Java 8 exam in 2024? is it wise to go pro level exam without clearing assoc first?<br><br>Would appreciate any tips or advice. thank you:)

I remember when I started coding in Python I struggled real hard. Not only with the thinking process but with the fact that the language takes a lot of stuff for granted that I didn&#39;t. I started with Pascal in school and wondered that I didn&#39;t need to declare variables, had no idea what variable type I had each time - I thought in a way too complicated for the language. Still my problem.<br>I often say I do quantum computing because I am too stupid to understand how normal computers work. With understand I mean understand each level and layer. Modern computers are way too complex. <br>A good friend once told me that he sucks at coding as well. He is one of the best hackers in my home country and suffers from the same issues I do.<br>What I still don&#39;t get is object orientated programming though.

You forgot microcode. This is code that translate ISA-level opcode, to data path signals, such as enabling input/output from/to registers, switching muxes, selecting ALU function, etc.
Nope sir you have to start from low level to high level. C and mastering memory concepts as minimum lazy boy.

This goes without saying, but for computer science a lot of the time the language doesnt matter - its simply a standard for transferring your human thought into a machine. The hard part of software development isn&#39;t editing code, it&#39;s designing solutions to business problems. After solutions are designed, then they are simply translated to code, and thats where programming languages come in.

HTML is not a programming language! JFC.
a senior software developer (I worked in the field for nearly 20 years now, PL/SQL, batch, bash, VB, C, C++, Java and probably some I&#39;m forgetting) reacting:<br>No, scratch is an awful place to start. It teaches you none of the basics. Even the log forgotten QBasic would have been better. It may make the base thinking process more accessible, sure, but that&#39;s like learning to sing by playing karaoke in the yakuza games. it teaches you the thinking process of reacting to sounds but nothing more.<br>and basic / Qbasic is also awful because it is way outdated, you can&#39;t really transport the stuff you learn to modern languages without losing most.<br>I&#39;d also recommend against python. Any weakly-typed language is easier than a strongly-typed one, sure, but that leniency makes it that new learners don&#39;t really understand what they do. besides, what was praised as a pro in the vid (no braces, semicolonsm etc) is actually a detriment, because most languages use them and when you get used to a language where line breaks mark the scope, it&#39;s hard to go to a language that doesn&#39;t do this (and vice versa, but most don&#39;t use whitespace as instructions)<br>And I wouldn&#39;t call JS a high level language. It&#39;s a script language, not a programming language. Batch, Bash, Powershell, etc are also not programming languages. html and css even more not so. And no, I never encountered a single person that would cancel anyone that says &quot;html is not a programming language&quot;. In fact, you would be cancelled if you said it was, because it isn&#39;t. It&#39;s in the name ffs, Markup Language.<br>And no, SQL is not a programming language either. Even PL/SQL, which is closer to a programming language, isn&#39;t one.<br>Honestly, none of these should really be in any vid comparing programming languages.<br>I disagree that java is a dumpster fire for beginners. Yes, some things are a bit more verbose than they would have needed to be (but that diminished heavily over the years, most examples you find are from years ago where reading a file included micromanagement like buffer and stuff while today it&#39;s just Files.readAllBytes()), but imposing having to make classes and shit is good for beginners, as many modern languages are object-oriented and that forces them to think in that way. (also, fuck intellij, eclipse for life lol. probably just a &quot;getting used to&quot; thing but whenever I&#39;m forced into intellij I wish it was eclipse)<br>promoting functional languages as the &quot;more based&quot; option sits wrong with me. Sure, they have their uses. But for most jobs, they&#39;re not the way to go. If you wanna get into programming, don&#39;t look into them unless you want to severely restrict the jobs you can get.<br>&quot;Rust doesn&#39;t have a garbage collector&quot; - neither does C, and neither does C++ unless you count autopointers which were a pretty recent addition, back when I used it they were only in the boost library. But I wouldn&#39;t call it garbage collection.<br><br>and.. esoteric but no brainfuck2d? no whitespace? no chef? my fav is BF2D just because the code looks so nice<br><br>anyway, wrote too much already.<br>for beginners, I really encourage you to use java. I like java (many don&#39;t but fuck em) and it has all the key elements you find in other modern often used languages. Strong types, proper scoping, object oriented. polymorphism, etc. Java makes it relatively easy to switch to, say, C++ or C# (which is basically c++ and java mashed together) or any modern language that doesn&#39;t try to reinvent the wheel, and java is not too hard to learn. You can also start with C# for the same reasons, but java has a graphical interface framework (spring) that works everywhere, while with c# you can use windows forms but that works on windows and not anywhere else, you need to use third party tools if you want it to run on apple or mobile or.. And seeing how a graphical interface is nowadays probably what most new programmers want as soon as possible..

In my university, the first programming language they teach us is C, followed by C++ and then moving on to assigning us projects (e.g. Artificial Intelligence, if you choose to take this subject later on) requiring knowledge of Python without actually spending time to teach us this language at that point. C is a very good beginner language because, like it was stated in the video, it&#39;s the language without which, a lot of the &quot;big&quot; ones in the industry now wouldn&#39;t exist.<br><br>Edit: They also teach us Assembly in the 1st year for the mandatory subject &quot;Computer Architecture I&quot; which as you can imagine is a pain in the ass...

Great ending
The best language to learn an actual legitimate language is probably C. It‚Äôs simple, low level, and you can still do a lot. After that, you‚Äôre going to want to upgrade to object oriented programming, so C++, Python, and Java, probably in that order. After that, JavaScript, C#/.NET, and other more developer based programming.<br><br>ChatGPT is a legitimate resource to help you code. You just got to use it write and make sure you‚Äôre understanding the concepts.

My fucking god in some years we are going to have more coding languages than actual languages, why in the world there&#39;s no convention and everyone is doing what they want? We need an unified universal coding language.
There are definite evolutionary dead ends. And as a Developer you should get a &quot;feel&quot; of why you like or don&#39;t like certain languages. Elixir for example... is a dead end. Weak typing, runtime interpretation,  .. all the pitfalls of java script...

As someone who is a complete programming illiterate who has always loved video games theres a certain question thats been on my mind for years now.  If one wanted to make a huge modern big budget game, lets lets say elden ring or somthing of that scale but stubbornly wanted to use only machine code.<br>Would that even be possible? <br>How long would it take? <br>If one were to use a more standardized modern language how much easier would it be and how much time would be saved?
HOLY CHƒ∞T
We started with Java at school. If I know some of it, will stuff like JavaScript, Python, and C and C++ be easier, or more difficult :(
Right... so... I have made small circuits with logic gates using transistors directly. Onesuch I made to control the channel switching of a tube amplifier I made. I never thought of it as a program, in fact, and less even as using a &quot;language&quot; (I think the concept doesn&#39;t apply here, really). <br>That&#39;s crazy cause I&#39;m busting my a** to learn C++ now, which is suposedly more accesible to a human. <br>I know a dude who programs in Assembly and he is outright scary. You wouldn&#39;t want that guy in a sinking ship deciding who lives and dies, I&#39;ll just say that.

Jr developer joke at the beginning isn&#39;t even a joke. And you better have 20+ years of experience with all of them!!!
the fact that I took racket my first semester of college..
we need a 2023 version of this video &lt;3
So what do I learn‚Ä¶
I wonder how people who start with python actually understand any other language later on. They practically lack half of the necessary knowledge for a programmer, that&#39;s why I&#39;d never hire somebody who knows only python.
Honestly&lt; if ure trying to learn programming seriously and to make a career out of it, there is no better option than c++. It teaches u the basics, isn&quot;t as hard as this dude made it out to be and helps u understand how memory management works. It also helps to build logic, which will make learning all the other languages easier.
But wat if God is a subdomain, not a domain???
I have always been mildly, passively interested in coding as a hobby, but dude, your videos have hyper-charged my interest! I&#39;m already doing side coding projects at work, but now I want to dive head first into it. Thanks, your video style is inspiring and entertaining!
üòÇüòÇüòÇ<br><br>So we really don&#39;t know how any of this works, we&#39;re just winging it. <br><br>Monkey pull lever, Monkey gets a shock, Monkey stop pulling lever. <br><br>Man pull lever, Man get a shock, Man still pull lever.
funny and educational
How we know what we know about CS
I learned programming on C and C++ and I got to say they&#39;re pretty great to begin with to fundamentally understand the flow of the software and memory menagment. It&#39;s like learning to swim by jumping directly in to deep waters. If you learn to code functional, stable apps in those language I think you&#39;re ready to go.
I come here to curse the sadistic bastard who thought it was a good idea to have 2 classes with assembly on the 2nd year of my computer science course
First language I tried to learn was C++ üòÇ<br>(because of minecraft)<br><br>Then I tried python because C++ is just &quot;Ehh&quot;
As a junior dev looking for inspiration - that made me finally go to sleep to have nightmares. That&#39;s enough internet for today. Thank you.<br>P.S. Loved the video.
Starting assembly this week and then machine language, we learn low level in my university at least
Thanks for mentioning my homeland Vietnam üòâ<br>Greetings from Berlin.
what about swift?
Imagine just seeing someone coding by typing 0&#39;s and 1&#39;s really fast. It would be like looking at an encrypted image or text 99.999% of people would not even be able to know what he is doing
I&#39;m learning c++ in high school and I find the pointers and the pass-by-referece a bit complicated but I kinda see why we learn c++ instead of java or python. C++ it&#39;s like a base programming and if you learn the synthax and the logic it&#39;s gonna be easy to switch to another programming language.
I regret the time I spent on PHP. If I had used the time to learn JS or Python, it would have paid a lot down the line. SQL has inspired me to go down the line of data analysis and I don&#39;t regret having chosen R as my primary tool now. I am dabbling towards Pyhon now tho.

I have no programming knowledge.  But this video blew my mind. Thank you.

The fact that we started in high-school with C++ scares me =)))
Started with c++ at school, ended up loving c# and once I&#39;m done I&#39;ll go back to c++ And master it as well.
No mention of Perl, not even version 6...üò¢
I would honestly argue HTML/CSS aren&#39;t programming languages, I think they&#39;re more structure languages than programming. <br>Disclaimer I&#39;m not a full programmer, I&#39;m doing a re-training to learn software development using java and sql, but I have some experience in the unity engine and I have bashed my head in over html/css. Also my dad (teaches java and databases at my local uni) said this, and I just agree with his point.

Dang, that reminded me of the horror show of doing AP C++ in HS about 21yrs ago.  It gave me so, SO many headaches.  Now, I don&#39;t know why, I&#39;m trying to get back into coding for a side gig (AKA I want to earn more $$$).  <br><br>So far, I&#39;ve done C++, Basic, Java, HTML, and CSS.  At the moment, my knowledge is beginner at best with minor concepts of how things work/should work.  I&#39;d love to figure out a good language to program with that&#39;ll be relevant in the next 10yrs with the advent of AI and Quantum Computing, quite possible Quantum AI Computing.

KTHXBYE
as an IT student in college in current, I still don&#39;t understand why my college let their beloved students learn Java at first üôÉ I mean we can clearly see that a large amount of students don&#39;t have foundation in programming and they are super confused when study Java bc of its syntax and method üôÉ just why
got tired of debugging java so i just switched to assembly
I was laughing until we hit the last layer and then saw the logic gates... now i just feel called out
Fun Fact: What is APL<br>&quot;It&#39;s a programing language&quot;
I don&#39;t know why I stayed to see these languages when I just work on JS and Python . Currently learning TypeScript. I dont give a shit about BrainFuck üòÇüòÇ
I started with Basic at age 9 in 1991... I hardly knew English at that age.. I simply used the Amiga Basic book that came with my computer and had a few magazines with code listings for a few games... <br><br>It was kind of a steep learning curve, but I got fascinated by how it was possible to tell a computer exactly what to do.<br><br>From there it went to ARexx to batch to HTML, Java script and SSI (what used to be known as DHTML) before I found php.<br><br>Of course, one couldn&#39;t make a truly dynamic homepage without having to deal with SQL, and it was good and pocket money to make, as a junior high around year 2000.<br><br>You may have noticed that  I did my best to avoid strict types and compiled languages... I feared it, seemed too complicated.<br><br>When I finally found the perfect education for me, I ended up managing a small group of servers running Linux in the first 3 years of my apprenticeship... that&#39;s where I met my first love of a language...<br><br>Perl can do everything, and even the most sparse Linux, even today, comes with perl preinstalled. Knowing regular expressions by heart makes it really easy to process whatever text output you face. I ended up knowing perl better than shell script, it was just more flexible.<br><br>However, as my education progressed, I had to face the enemy I feared... strictly typed and compiled languages.<br><br>School taught me ANSI C on a microcontroller platform, my apprenticeship taught me Delphi (pascal) for GUI and PL/SQL for databases beyond the simple MySQL lookup. Luckily Pascal and PL/SQL share a lot of syntax and types.<br><br>C# was kinda easy to learn with a Delphi, perl and C background... Delphi and C#/.NET were designed by the same architect. Java isn&#39;t difficult as such, but finding the right libraries to use is a treasure hunt I never got good at.<br><br>The RADs (rapid application development) were way ahead of Java when it came to easy access to libraries. <br><br>I&#39;ve only recently taken the step to learn python... and I don&#39;t love it. You can typecast your variables, but the interpreter doesn&#39;t stop you from changing the type during execution... it&#39;s basically up to your editor to tell you that you&#39;re doing a mistake.. and an integer has no fixed size or signage... you really have to think about that if you&#39;re doing binary communication with a microcontroller... if I invert a byte binary what is the output?<br><br>Of course one could laugh about Pascal having a longbool, but at least it was predictable.<br><br>On the other hand, python is very maintainable being a JIT language. No need to recompile for various CPUs and operating systems etc. but I miss strict typing when dealing with hardware.
Not what is knowledge, but what is language. Thanks for the value

name a video where you can watch it thoroughly till the end yet simply not understand anything
Bro, I absolutely love your content and your extremely broad and diverse understanding of these topics especially how they are related to nature. Im not sure if you are just joking around on some of the stuff you have stated but the TRUTH is out there. You&#39;re explanation of using lightning on runes not seen with the human eye that use extremely advanced abstractions from nature is on point. The Womb is the entrance this matrix as stated in Exodus. Christ was the programmer that stepped into the program to fix the virus.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pEfrdAtAmqk&amp;t=242">4:02</a> well this may be changing soon. There&#39;s a new JEP out that proposes to add an unnamed class and also allow the main method to be non-static.
Kekw In university you usually start with C

My dude, that transistor up there is BJT while in modern VLSI architecture (specially below 10 nm) they use exclusively of MOSFET&#39;s!<br>BTW looneys started teaching us C++ and Assembly back in extra curriculum in our high school and that&#39;s part of the reason of what I am today! I wanted to be an astronaut, DAMN YOU! Back then we didn&#39;t even know what Von Neumann architecture is!
I have a newbie (probably stupid) question. Why bother learning different programming languages when all they do is get compiled to some kind of computer code? Why not just skip a step and program using computer code that CPUs and other types of PUs use? Surely it&#39;s easy to learn.
Lol about ajavska
HTML is not a programming language, never has been, never will be, it&#39;s called markup language from the very second they teach it to you for a reason, it doesn&#39;t have variables, anyone who says otherwise needs special help.
Transistor language is very easy to learn. Ive been a Transistor Developer for 42 years.
Calm down bro
If you aren&#39;t programming on a clay tablet, you&#39;re doing it wrong
That was also convincing until I noticed the glitch, a diversion to keep us enslaved to the machine..... No mention at all of Perl. The glue that holds the internet together. The Swiss army knife of coding, with so many ways to do it (badly). No one else can understand your code, and in two weeks neither can you.
I have spent 5 years programming and I know less now than I did before I picked up my first programming book. But thanks to this video I will try emojicode to redem myself

PLEASE is very important in InterCal. If the programmer doesn&#39;t use it frequently, the code won&#39;t compile, because the programmer was not polite. And if used too often, results in error that the programmer was excessively polite...

IDK man, from one perspective, brainfuck is incredibly hard to learn, but from another, it is just incredibly simple. So what is it? Same with assembly, it is essentially just which buttons to press in order on a slightly more complicated calculator.

You can really stop at electronics here, QED isn&#39;t a legitimate physics field, more like a squiggle session. But at least it makes for good sci fi
this video brings garbage information to newcomers, author you were messed up with the most unimportant thing for being a good programmer, you don&#39;t need to compare the programming languages, it is a waste of time, any programming language is good, choose one of them that is enough, at most 2. One high-level and one for lower level. After gaining the proficiency in one language you will understand all the languages, language will become just a tool which have the same purpose. I am pythonist and C++ is my favorite language, i know bash, and i never took a java courses, but I can understand all the lines that is written in java,  I also understand GO. So, don&#39;t waste your time with languages, pick one and get proficiency, at the end you understand that all languages are the same piece of shit
we learned c the moment i entered first year. i didnt know any programming before that. when i found python, my head still worked in round about ways and finding out shortcut codes made my heart so happy and i thought i found a cheat language not realizing everyone else from the rest of the world learned python first. the pro is that now no matter what language i encounter now, it doesnt phase me anymore. the con is that i get disgusted by the fact that i learned c, c++ and jave for three years straight in that order only to find out after the ojt that noone in the industry needed my knowledge on it bcs they wanted me to have experience on the more advanced languages like python or even the web development stuff. so that sucks
What the fuck is this
wtf is that ending

Learning 90% of those languages is a complete waste of time. Pick between C, C++, C#, Java or Javascript ecosystems, forget about everything else and you will do fine.

Hey guys. Don‚Äôt make it hard like this video. Just do it the easy way by being a natural born math genius like me. Then you don‚Äôt need to pick a specific language to learn, because you can naturally read and write all of them at a perfect level. ü•±üòé

Dear world,<br>WHY THE HELL AREN&#39;T WE USING EMOJI CODE????
I think assembly is actually useful for troubleshooting reasons today
im in 12th grade, and we have 4 languages taught to us;  Visual Basic, HTML, C++ and Assembly 8085. Funfact, we are also taught logic gates and construction of binary program structures using transistors and other electronic components. if im not mistaken, the average cs college course only teaches you JS and/or .NET
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pEfrdAtAmqk&amp;t=35">0:35</a> FunFact : thats how our tears look like under a microscopeüíÄ
If you want to learn assembly and mashine code on a 4-16 Bit basis in a fun and easy way, I can recommend the game &quot;Turing Complete&quot; which makes you build a small computer from scratch and then teaches you to code directly with the hardware. Fun little thing to understand code in its simplest form on a hardware level.
I dont understandddddd
No love for Perl üò¢
For those of you worried dont<br><br>Only like a fraction of these are actually used by more then 5 or 6 people, or a specific company.
bruh the ending üò≠üòÇ
I don&#39;t know if it is funny or sad to me that your iceberg missed about half the languages I have used professionally, and I have actually used almost half of the languages you did cover. <br><br>The number of languages developed for one-off scripting purposes before Lua became the standard solution is mind boggling. Then you also have the microcontroller specific languages that are higher level than assembly, but not fully compliant with any &quot;real&quot; language. Maybe those should be considered flavors of the language they are modeled after since they are usually a perfect sub-set of the real language&#39;s functionality, presumably because it started as an attempt to make a C compiler for the new architecture but only the parts needed by that initial team were ever implemented, or incomplete because the language chosen was wholly incompatible with the underlying tech (embedded java for 16 bit EMV cards).
This is quickly becoming my favorite YouTube channel.
wow
as an Indian, I like the deathbed picture you used
i hate how in india, the engineering colleges start teaching from the bottom, all the way up to top of the iceberg. also there is no programming taught before college.
I&#39;d like to add that the minimal amount of symbols needed for a turing-complete language is 6 (brainfuck has 8) and there is a language that has realized this beautiful obscenity
The last bit was iconic üòÇ
fantastico.
I remember Java. She was my first programming language. I hate that 6!tch to this day.
It‚Äôs important to realize that no one learns all these languages.
Every dev is talking about his 20 years of experience in programming. Me who  learned 2 languages their framework last 2 years and have created complex websites and apps but still know nothing rather than declaring variable

I love how thorough all this is and how well-organized it is.
Do the glorious Days of the mid-90s when I started my internet programming we&#39;re all I needed to know was Pearl and HTML. There was no CSS or JavaScript and even images were frowned upon. Those days were beautifully simple. Now I watch as Junior struggle to learn a fraction of what they need to know to do their jobs and I feel great pity for them. Of course even I have a hard time keeping up and I&#39;ve been doing this for over 25 years. Nowadays I just look forward to retiring so I can leave this rat race.

I used elm for like 2 weeks in high school cause my teacher wanted us to play around with user interfaces and graphics and my god it was the absolute worst thing to try to learn. Everyone hated it so much that he just scrapped the elm assignment and never did it again in any of his courses
How can I learn rust as pro? Who can suggest any course many find good
What about PEGA? I knew someone who‚Äôs company was offering a 10k referral bonus if they could find someone who knew the language.
All you need is C# and SQL my friend. You don&#39;t need to speak 14 languages to write a book
You forget the dreamberd language
&quot;Any application that can be written in JavaScript, will eventually be written in JavaScript&quot;<br>Oh god. I wrote a software 3D engine in JavaScript. Not because it&#39;s useful, not because it&#39;s fast, not even because I&#39;m using it for anything, just because it could be done. Edit: Oh, it&#39;s also unreleased and will never be, lol.
I loved it!‚ù§
man i just wanted a roadmap.....
Oh okay, so first I need to study philosophy. Thanks
I started programming with C++ and it&#39;s much more difficult than other languages. It&#39;s very mathematical. A language for true chads üóø
Ever heard of mumps. A hospital had this program that was made for medical environment.
i got tired and lost after 30 seconds. Talking too fast.
WhyTF did I click this video while taking a break after learning how to program Hello World in Python?
I dove straight into C++ with a 4 hour course and using ChatGpt for additional insight. I could never imagine bullshitting myself by starting off with something like scratch even without ChatGpt
&quot;soy based languages&quot; is what I&#39;m gonna write in my CV now
Guys, I&#39;m only starting and have zero clue about anything (except some HTML); please help me know where to start.
Wrong. The best place to learn programming is K&amp;R.
I especially like the shout-out to COBOL. I took 2 semesters of it back in the day and I&#39;ve often thought there would be some serious money programming professionally in it (pun intended as it&#39;s used so much in banks).
I got Jebaited wtf, I thought u was gonna tell me what to learn to earn bruv
How can I give that much time to machine? Development means much more complex life. Finally understood one popular saying, Simplicity is Vaishnavism.
Back in uni they made us learn assembly for microcontrollers, imagine how amazed I was when the class following that the made us open python üòÖ
GLSL, CG, HLSL not included
Humans were made different
Meanwhile me that is stuck to what should I name my new project
where gdscript
Try politics, most unpleasant programming language of all.
Paradoxically, I think the more you know the more you become aware of all the things you don&#39;t know.
Makes me wanna shoot my computer and then rebuild it, while smiling.
I started at Java, and having had no real prior base it really sucked. This made me feel better that it was mentioned as a dumpster fire for beginners because for beginners, yes. Still hate Java tho
You put JSfuck in your chart but skipped it. I&#39;m triggered.

I studied quantum electrodynamics but now I can‚Äôt correctly account for gravity? Where do I go from here
this fucked my brain up
I just found out that Go is developed by and at Google to replace C, at first I thought Go was to replace Java. Pascal is on the same level or category as C ? Because as I knew, Pascal can interact with Assembly which is a low level language. Pascal became a popular language before C was popular even though it was developed after C ? What still intrigues me to this day is how low-level languages like Assembly were developed ? Are you a developer ? If so, what is the programming language do you use ? You have broad knowledge of programming languages.
Awesome video i think the only one you could have added was regular expressions
Thank god AI is here to help people with Code learning
Thank you for scaring the shit outta me! Now I&#39;m gonna quit programming and maybe go to a mental asylum. üòÄ

i missing VBA
On what app or thing is he writing all of these languages on ?
After watching this I started remembering back like an afterlife that how many languages I actually know.
Zig is my favorite modern language. Not big on garbage collectors, plus I love the low-level and hate C macros. The way it deals with structs is kinda crazy though. Unless you define a constructor, a strict acts like a namespace. (I like this feature, since lack of namespacing makes C annoying as heck)
Did I just get a CS degree watching this?  Love the channel!! üòÇüòÇüòÇ
god help anyone trying to code from scratch !!!
You skipped VHDL and Verilog for soft hardware programming
the only programming thing that I know is the wiggle animation effect in after effects scripts
Oh my fucking god<br>As electronics engineer i had to learned compiler, logic gatter, machine code and how transistors work on a molecular level. <br><br>Pain<br><br>But funy to see that i startet from the bottom.

When you started to talk about meme languages which seemed like a bonus content for the end of the video while there was no mention of stuff like assembly I started to question myself: are they not programming languages? Is it considered the realm of magic?
Holy C is the only language u need
Thank you, going for UPSC after this!
I skipped all the programming and went directly to the last one apparently.
Good one‚Ä¶ thank you for sharing about programming languages
maybe ill better stay with scratch <a href="UCkszU2WH9gy1mb0dV-11UJg/NvgfY9aeC_OFvOMPkrOAsAM"></a> great video tho
the ending was so fucking real you have no idea. everything is connected. also where is visual basic? lol
Feels more like a &quot;No life&quot; road map =)
wonderful &#39;-)
I&#39;ve yet to see anyone produce an &quot;iceberg&quot; video of value.
Senior dev with graduate degree in computer engineering here; super great summary. The only issue is that the fractal iceberg needs a mario-style ascending beanstalk that leads to weird worlds such as &quot;Prompt Engineering&quot; and AGI
Alright I think I&#39;m just gonna learn English instead. IM OUTTA YR KTHXBYE
I am still upset that a fictional framework using only integers and while loops is not mentioned here. As this<br> is still Turing complete.
So many languages to communicate with computers üò¢üò¢
WTF did I just watch?
this was so informative, and also funny af at the same time, thank you! üòÑ
I can use 2 Languages. Scratch and C and maybe C++
what did i just watch...
best video so far
no way man I really studying pascal in highschool
I was genuinely taken aback by the ending in the best way possible! It completely surprised me, but in a delightful and heartwarming manner.
python would normally be best to start someone off..  but most aim for webdev and in that line of work python isn&#39;t the place most can start.
lol the ending was so good!
I&#39;ll stick to python... thx
At the transistor level... you happen to show a diagram of a transistor with a Emitter base and collector. This is a BJT transistor and is generally not used for building computers. It is MOS tech with Source, G8 and drain... the rest seems fine tho :)
dudee stop stop STOOOOP
deep shit thx. worth my time

Video Unclear , I quit my Developing Gig and now own a Cattle Farm.
Cool. Simple and brief explanation of computer programming history
It&#39;s cool that at the end of the video you recognize the essence of philosophy and metaphysics that analogically include computing and other topics that are essential to create hardware and software
I just lost all my interest in programming
What if I already solved epistemology what do I do next??!?!
My masters degree was in Physics and we learned Fortran as a part of our course. Probably because it is still a pretty fast language for implementing algorithms important for scientific computation, and also because it still has good support for a lot of scientific equipment and instruments, including older instruments. I don&#39;t think it is used in any sort of consumer-end technology anymore.
shitpost
Thank you kind sir, with this knowledge now I can skip all of those programming languages and tap straight into my genetic code so I can run programs directly on my body for maximum efficiency and zero delay.

i dissapointed that you have missed Perl - this is one of pillars of programming languages
useless vid
Aren&#39;t html and css a form of markdown?
Repent, sinner- Heil GOD
I love the content and how informative and accurate it is. But I think the video title is quite misleading. Initially I clicked because I wanted to know what I need to learn in order to become a good developer. Thought the title could have been &quot;Programming Languages Iceberg Explained&quot; or something.
&quot;Lua is easier and faster than python&quot; <b>*Python fans proceeds to attempt cancel this channel*</b>
Lol java was my first programming language
I think You forgot:<br>- Forth - has a niche in astronomical and space applications but... may BIOSes had forth interpreters and internally coded in forth; <br>- perl - camel is present on iceberg, but You didn&#39;t mentioned it - very important language.
This video started with sanity and descended into madness at the end o.o
my college is literally teaching us assembly in the first semester
this is incredible. i love learning about all these languages even the meme type languages. all the way down to the assembly and binary language. its so interesting i want to learn them all! i&#39;ll stick to python for now though
many people think you can get job if you know 1 language but it&#39;s completely bs. I haven&#39;t seen any company who hires anyone as developer if he only knows 1 or 2 languages. You may know java, c# or python but there are so many other stuff they require. Most of time, for java developer position, they require you to know spring framework, sql as well as react or angular + clouding technology like aws or azure and docker, jackins and system designing skills etc etc. It&#39;s so frustrating that you have to know so much to get developer jobs. :(
I&#39;m screwed....
LISP is interesting, because CAD functions still rely heavily on modified LISP programs. I code primarily in LISP because I&#39;m a draftsman and I use it to draw plans.

No
To be or not to be
So i started from working with C++ where we were given leetcode style problems to solve in my university and then learned a little bit of Java through Android Studio and currently i work with JavaScript and React making my journey opposite to what it should&#39;ve been üòÇ
No delphi?
You don&#39;t have Java listed, I unsubscribe from your channel!

Where the FK is GLSL?!?!?! WHeRe THAHHH FKKKK ISSS GLLLLSSSSSLLLLL?!!?!?  GLSL PLEB!
Nice video. I missed one that I used allot, Forth. A stack oriented, reverse polish, concatenated language.
I tried to learn Python first, but I gave up. First programming language I learned was C++. I still find it easier than Python to this day. Maybe I&#39;m just weird. . .
Surprised you didn&#39;t include Perl
Are there any other assembly 8086 programmers here with me?
I think you forgot such an important language as Rockstar. The ultimate goal of every 10x developer.
Fun fact: games such as Pokemon red and blue were written in Assembly
No way! not sure where you get your data from. C, C++, Java/JavaScript, Python are the very top of programming for any SERIOUS developer. Rust, Go, etc. are more application/platform specific languages which come and go. C/C++ is most valuable, web technologies follow with higher level languages like JS after, PHP etc.
no powerbuilder nooooo
im so scared rn
I hate Scratch
OMG! You just degraded me from a point where i already thought no coding youtubers create a app/script/ui
none of them satisfy me. Guess I&#39;m on my way to make my own one

HTML is a markup language not a programming language. It&#39;s in its name.
chad devs listen up
Can&#39;t help but notice that Minecraft Redstone didn&#39;t make the list. What gives?
there&#39;s so much to know... now that i&#39;ve learned a good amount of html, css, javascript, and python, I feel like learning C (if its actually easy to learn as they say) may be valuable to get an understanding of how some of these higher-level languages are constructed.<br><br>edit: also, &quot;always bet on JS, you&#39;ll never lose&quot; feels like good advice tbh
Lol, I&#39;ve at least some experience in most of the tiers and while professionally I use more of the the higher tiers on my spare time I descent to the dungeons of programming with logic gates and machine code
TempleOS and HolyC are ultimate God-tier.
colleges teaching C in 1st sem: Allow us to introduce ourselves
Down in the second lowest tier you will find languages designed for radiation hardened processors used in satellites. So obscure and rare the language dies with the inventor.
future developers here, if you are stressed come meditate with me!‚ù§
Your lack of Z80 ASM is pretty lame as well.
Ok, but where is redstone?
There is a dangerous myth in there. By devising a functional quantum computer (or anything really very special that is already coveted) most probably you won‚Äôt be rich. Someone else with the appropriate credentials, means and ‚Äúright place‚Äù will steal it. Perhaps you‚Äôll get something good out of it or perhaps you‚Äôll end dead. But that is the real world we live in.
Ah yes, my favourite programming language: TRANSISTORS

why are these videos talking at 200 words a second ?
I love you
you left out microcode! =)
Meh , dude,  u missed Verilog and VHDL
Please be serious... You put CSS HTML PHP Lua R SQL and Ruby in a lower rank than JS and Python, they should have be in the same rank...
and then the swiss decided to call it brainf**k
I usually work with python and javascript (+ whatever framework is the hype flavor of the day right now) but I want to learn a final 3rd language as well.<br>I dabbled in C# before but I don&#39;t like being married to microsoft so that&#39;s a no go. <br>Java is an obvious alternative but maybe it&#39;s all a bit too high level for me.<br>C and C++ seem like obvious choices but it feels like average guys like me would just waste their time as we&#39;re never gonna make anything of actual use with those languages.<br>So the only remaining choice is assembler, obviously.
As a computer science student I confirm it&#39;s not that complex. I mean it is complex but not this complex.
Personally I would never choose scratch over a node-based system like the one in UE Blueprint or Blender. The node programming is so much more accessible and controllable, especially with the folders and connections. Not to mention every node is like a card where you can read its stats while scratch is more like a sentence which is an absolute pain to make math expressions with.
I&#39;m in web dev since 2003. And I can clearly state that HTML and CSS are not even close to programming languages. They are the contents and visual representation. Just google the abbreviation, it&#39;s self explanatory. Move over. JavaScript is not programming language either. Just as it states. JS is scripting language. So does Phyton and PHP.
Mind blown! <a href="UCkszU2WH9gy1mb0dV-11UJg/LsMfY8P6G-yckNAPjoWA8AI"></a>
Disappointed the Turing Complete programming language LaTeX was not mentionned
I started with Python, then C++, then Verilog and System Verilog, and now Assembly. (Im in EE) I&#39;ve liked each language more than the last UNTIL assembly... I just dont get it and I hate how it is assembler-specific
gwat damn
Me: does my academic research in R, bash, C++, and SQL<br>Also Me: Makes a horrendously big to learn list based on this iceberg to actually communicate the science.
COBOL, my beloved
What about VHDL and Verilog!
If you wanna feel like an idiot, remember RCT2 was written in assembly.
Rust isn&#39;t a programming language. It&#39;s a language for morons.
you can tell the people that created the names for these languages have lost their sanity. the names have no rhyme or reason‚Ä¶

This Video answered many of questions i never asked out loud, but left me with more question than i could ever possible ask!
Why did you have to end with that existential crisis stuff man..üòÇ
Great video, but was the existential crisis at the end really necessary??
Can someone help explain what all these terms are? object oriented, garbage collector? static type (what does that even mean) and so on?? I love coding and do a lot of html, css, swift and python, and am trying to expand to some terminal coding and possibly c++/c, but what on earth are all these terms, and where do people go to pick up all this knowledge? YouTube is great but seems kind of inefficient when it comes to this kind of stuff
The programming languages I know are Basic, JavaScript, and C++. Good enough for my projects and jobs as electrical engineer. May learn python too but that will be my last programming language
I solved it in examüòÅ<br>BTW love your videos
ü§î
what am I?
The 2 best programming languages are Ti-Basic and HP49G programming. No one I know has made any improvements to either into a more advanced language
Nobody can be in any way comparable to God. Please change the title.
I&#39;m a senior majoring in Cyber sec... I downloaded pycharm once and made it print hello world... I barely understood half of the vocabulary in this video and now I&#39;m terrified.

The awesome roadmap aside, are you secretly John Mulaney the comedian? Been listening to him quite a bit recently and I gotta say you sound identical to him if only calmer. ü§î
Rust is like The Wire of programming languages. It&#39;s fairly solid, but people who use it literally cannot stop talking about it and will always try to peer pressure you into switching to it at any moment programming gets brought up.<br><br>If its community goes too much further and it&#39;ll end up getting the title of the &quot;Rick and Morty&quot; of programming languages.

I can write the word hELL0 upside down on my calculator
funny that the first programming language i learned is java
So I shouldn&#39;t have started with C++ ? üòÇüíÄ
Who writes in Binary?
Started programming in Java since 1997 and started understanding how to do object modeling using Peter Coad&#39;s approach also around that time. After over 10 years of extensive prpgramming in Java, its stuck in my head even when helping my junior programmers debugging code in non Java. After over 10 years of thinking in Object Models, its stuck in my head even for non IT work. The plus side is that it helps me learn new stuff fairly complete albiet a bit slower due to needing to identify the important domains of the new area / subject.<br>I find object modeling and Java to be fairly easy and allows my small team  of 2 programmers to maximise code and data reuse. With over 30 systems developed since 2008 with seamless data integration and business rules reused, new systems developed typically reused plenty of existing components.
am i the only one who climbed it from bottom?
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pEfrdAtAmqk&amp;t=592">9:52</a> this is not correct. The first high level programming language was Plankalk√ºl (1948), designed by German engineer Konrad Zuse.
That was perfect...<br>I was going to be mad if you didn&#39;t mention assembly....but then you mentioned it, transistors, and epistemology... and I loved it.
Funny how all Vietnamese students first language is FPC, which is free verson of Pascal. Some hardcore took Asembly. We litterally begin our program career from the botton of the ice berg

i love how despite this iceberg being commonly agreed on my school insists that the mandatory introduction to computer science class teach only drracket and netlogo (python java and such forth are for later cs courses after intro to cs)
So, start with Quantum Electrodynamics, got it. Thanks!
Lol
perl, awk or bash?
bro i studied in highschool Pascal, and that was 8 yrs ago. isnt that stupid ? xDDDDDD
Me programming my calculator in machine code: Wait, I&#39;m still not deep enough in the iceberg.
so if i summarize , we went from scratch to quantum physics for then to speak of philosophy. NEAT
i didnt even know that python was made by my own country! (netherlands)
learning
learned
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pEfrdAtAmqk&amp;t=592">9:52</a> I knew something was off about my university. Even furthermore, they expect us to debug fortran on paper
Calling SQL &quot;squeal&quot; from now on and waiting to see what my coworkers think or if they even notice
Wow I knew there were a lot of programming languages but this is insane. So many new ones too. Really overwhelming!
the ending of this video is amazing. pure storytelling.
The reality is knowledge is power, until you alter your state of consciousness and consequently forget what you thought you knew.
I have been stuck on that last level since college man
I like the part when you talk about javascript with that meme song!!
Rust is absolute trash. Why did I allow myself to get fooled into learning this failure of a language?
Bro i just wanted to learn python
Amazing video. Learned C and ASSEMBLY on my electrical engineering grad. Now I only use Python üôÇ
<a href="UCkszU2WH9gy1mb0dV-11UJg/xsIfY4OqCd2T29sP54iAsAw"></a>
Am I going down the iceberg or is the iceberg going up me?
<b>me using gdev</b> huh, looks like i dont exsist
Is it normal that I&#39;m sweating watching this video as a junior web developer?
That‚Äôs so amazing..<br><br>Infant my kids o watch it in 20 yrs
Did not understand shit but oddly find myself wanting to torture myself with learning a language. Any recommendations?
You only need html, css, js, php, sql and a good idea to  became rich.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pEfrdAtAmqk&amp;t=33">0:33</a> love the sarcasm in these videos
@<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pEfrdAtAmqk&amp;t=410">6:50</a> What the hell did he say? &quot;...compilers that make all the other ???-based languages possible.&quot;
u do assembly in 1. semester
I did not think Haxe was represented more in depth, in resume:<br><br>Haxe is an OOP language transitioning to multiparadigm that compiles to JS/C++/JAVA/PY/PHP/C#/LUA code, JVM/SWF bytecode and has two virtual machines, the predecessor NekoVM and the successor Hashlink, the language is primarily focused on making games with heaps, OpenFL among other engines and it can be used by any engine like Unity.
The Only thing I know is NOTHING
Lolcode actually made me lol
What about hardware design languages like Verilog üò¢
how much time will it take to master all of these languages?
compiling programs written in GO sucks if you don&#39;t feel like learning GO
What monstrosity of a video
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pEfrdAtAmqk&amp;t=313">5:13</a> &quot;Most people afraid to going deeper&quot; as an embedded coder I&#39;m afraid to going upper. C? Assembly? Most logical best languages for me. Need something too easy? C# And C++ Helps.
I don&#39;t want to be a dick, but this is pretty frustrating to see.<br><br>PROLOG is declarative (excluding the &quot;cut&quot;), and specific to expert systems. SQL is similar, but for databases. They are both so high-level as to not be useful for generic coding -- they should be at the top, or left out.<br><br>Along those lines, HTML isn&#39;t even a programming language.<br><br>BASIC was high-level for its day, but conventional BASIC code uses line numbers &amp; jumps for control flow. Instead of variable scope and proper functions you get memory address literals. It&#39;s arguably more like machine language than most of the others.<br><br>Why is Ruby below Python &amp; JS? They&#39;re all roughly the same in terms of expressiveness, but if we&#39;re going to force a distinction, Ruby is higher-level. It has a superset of the others&#39; features, a much better story about FP, proper message passing, easier metaprogramming, easy eDSLs, and more. JS didn&#39;t even have classes until a few years ago.<br><br>And speaking of Lisps... Python&#39;s &quot;lambdas&quot; were intentionally hobbled, which has a huge impact on expressivity. Anything with proper lexical closure should go above it, including Common Lisp.<br><br>Why is TS lower than JS -- the type checker? Why are all of the languages that allow currying down near C? Good lord, why any of this?
Scratch is definitely easy.  I created an rpg battle engine in an hour.
Why did you miss Dr. Racket and Perl üò≠ they are the best.........,......
I know nothing, thanks to you.
I can program in nandgame asm. What tier is that?
I think you have forgotten verilog and VHDL (hardware descriptive languages)
Not a bad little effort... shame you stopped short of Ontology... although you got a &#39;god mode&#39; in there so... cool_thnx - my cat approves! :D
Most pathetic video on the internet I must say
I recommend everyone stop watching after <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pEfrdAtAmqk&amp;t=325">5:25</a>
So‚Ä¶ that was a trip
Didn&#39;t expect to see Ada!<br><br>Personally I like to use Java, C, and AMD64 assembly (Intel syntax, through NASM) the most.<br><br>It&#39;s funny as someone who actually programs in assembly that everyone still calls assembly on modern x86 based CPUs x86 assembly, when in reality pretty much every 64 bit CPU uses an AMD64 instruction set, and good luck running an X86 program on that when all your syscalls do an INT 0x80 instead of the SYSCALL instruction.
Bro missed out on Verilog :(
Nice scripting, especially towards the end.
MIND. BLOWN.
4 minutes in and I&#39;m already stressed
If you ever do something like this again you should include forth (which is nice and actually used) and postscipt
Many (if not all) languages can be multi platform provided they‚Äôre available on a platform
No one worth listening to pronounces SQL as squeal.
HTML is NOT a programming language, it‚Äôs a data notation/symbology.
I quit at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pEfrdAtAmqk&amp;t=566">9:26</a> can&#39;t take it anymore
Am I the only one who heard a female voice in the background sometimes?
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pEfrdAtAmqk&amp;t=965">16:05</a> is said in vedas lol
Im surprised he didn&#39;t mention anything about Industrial programming languages like Ladder, Structured text, or at least SCL. Almost all industrial devices worldwide are running on one of these languages.
I only like strongly typed languages. They seem harder to learn but as soon as you try something like python after C# you really miss it.
I was looking through the top comments expecting a &quot;we all miss Terry&quot;. Here you go.
You missed matlabüòÇüòÇ
Yeah, If you want to explode you brain, no C,C++ or any high level language, just use assembly language.    Most sane people do not use this.
I&#39;m sorry, could you repeat that.
Only God can create life clown. Use that term for the only one who deserves it.
am i the only one that absolutely hates scratch? i was first introduced to it when i did cs50 a while back and i found it more difficult than the c i learnt there idk i may just be dumb but thats the worst thing i ever learnt
Ewww JS
I know nothing, would using a lesser used language with your website make it harder to hack? For instance SQL injection not working due to the languages being different?
there is one more level down, the Turing Machine which although isn&#39;t really coded but built it can do everything possible with a computer
Please make an epistemology  video.

Amazing ending
Saving this video for anytime i become too comfortable as software engineer so i can question my abilities and study harder.
I started with 68000 assembly back in the Amiga days, then x86 assembly, then high level languages like Pascal, &#39;C&#39;, and C++, which all seemed so easy after years of assembly language. My favourite language is good old-fashioned Ansi &#39;C&#39; followed by 68000 asm. My least favourite languages are Objective-C and MIPS asm.
Meanwhile me, who stareted with C++ and enjoys it:
Python+Flask is above all...Better than PHP, better than JS, better than My SQL
if Anders Hejlsberg touched it, it&#39;s gold!
The shuttle background noise coming up from time to time drove me nuts!<br>Cool recap otherwise
Come on man I still program in pascal as my main language
Where did my recommendation page  took me to?
thought i was smart until you told me c++ ain&#39;t the shit
Great video! Tho I would have also added a dedicated layer for hardware description languages (basically circuit designs), programming FPGAs with hardware languages like VHDL, Verilog and SystemVerilog these are the languages you use to design CPUs and ICs, to design the transistor placements (oversimplifying a lot here), these are the ones used by companies (not facts as I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs stated anywhere officially, this is just an educated guess that is quite likely) like Intel, AMD and othes to make the actual processors that run your machine code! (the thing that gets compiled from your assembly for anyone wondering). You can read more here if intrested: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hardware_description_language">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hardware_description_language</a>
Catch a breath Man! This was so hard to understand at that speed as to render it as a zero.
You forgot MatLab (+ Stateflow- state graph ) and DirectX (+ HLSL - shader language).

My man forgot about Holy C
I settled down on Typescript and Rust 3 years ago with some Dart for mobile.
I was so confused between c++ or Java <br>BUT NOW thanks to you i convert ac current from electronic wire to DC current while closing and opening circuits to receive a fully functional binary code on my television screen.... I have practically became an alternative to transistors or even electricity itself
So glad I started with Java and C as my first programming languages, not necessarily I was forced into it or I had no choice, In a way I love how hard it was, it paid off though I could just look at php or javascript and can quickly adapt to the language with little to no effort
when he said god tier roadmap, he literally meant it!
Wow, Raju made into the video.  I do request everyone watch the movie &quot;3 Idiots&quot;.
Absolutely brilliant!
Java is Canadian
I techincally started with Batch and Html (some javascript) in hs, but that was over a decade ago.<br><br>To jump back in.. I started with C and soon assembly.<br><br>I also.. did follow that rabbit trail into the quantum.<br>I started learning electronics and programming at the same time.
I went top to bottom to middle
real programmers code with millions of dip switches in binary
My eyes have been opened. Please make a video on god-tier map for PYTHON,  which will include how to do everything with PYTHON or related to PYTHON.
so in the end all comes down to epistemology
Very impressed that my father knows C++ inside and out, who uses it for signal processing and electronic engineering. Im an electrochemist and have no clue about any form of programming, wish I did though
Thank you for this, I&#39;m gonna switch degrees.
what a misleading title
I took a class named &quot;Languages&quot; where I had to do small projects in every main coding paradigm. So for example, I had to code connect-4 (the game) in Racket, with a greedy algorithm to play against, and since we were focusing in the functional paradigm, we weren&#39;t allowed to use &quot;let&quot;, &quot;map&quot; or &quot;define&quot; to store variables since that is not entirely functional. To make it worse, you only have two weeks to do this projects ü•¥
And you didn&#39;t said that some logic gates are activated with electric charge and others are activated with lack. Just to be consistent üòÇ
And Pascal was my first üòä
After 5th it&#39;s a lot easier üòâ

Maybe you are alright I guess
you forgot batch and VBscript which I use daily xD
awesome shit... =)
You know, I think I might go learn zig ... No reason for it, just ... Feel a connection to it.
I wanna learn the Chef programming language
bro has an existential crisis at the end :(
i don&#39;t write the code, the code writes me

That ending was really fun for me. XD ü§£<br>Good info as to the rest. Thanks!
I know it seems too difficult, but to understand the basics it isn&#39;t, it&#39;s like 6 college courses.
You forgot one language. It&#39;s DNA. It&#39;s a language living things are made of.
I need to master transistors. I have an idea that will blow everyone&#39;s mind so I will keep it to my self until I learn and implement transistors logic.
I have no idea how such a good YouTuber like you can still make the beep unacceptably loud, didn&#39;t you watch it back to check if it&#39;s volume fits with the rest of the video?
Obviously brainfuck is the best programming language
tbh I don&#39;t really know which is more nightmare fuel for a beginner coder: an esoteric language that is useless (so you won&#39;t need to learn it) or assembly (that is a must, yet more concise)
Holy shit, the end escalated quickly.

I was accepted as an intern in a High end company, all their low end programming was written in a modified version of C. I wanted to commit die.
As a software Engineer, you lost me at Java üòÖ
bro wtf...IM IN
C misses a buildin easy and safe string type and using null as terminator makes it uhm unsafe and inflexible. Don&#39;t mix data and logic. <br><br>C++ is just the most terrible language which just throws all paradigm together and has no coherence and somehow is popular because programmers like being godlike important and obnoxious for others üòÖ.  <br><br>All the modern alternatives miss the eco system and integrated development experience. Code completion, refactoring, interactive debugging, a GUI framework, designer, ...<br><br>Web dev is another hell. Framework on framework on framework and every few years another one pops up and its just all stacked and wired/patched up and non visual for a visual end experience. <br><br>What happened to the streamlined experiences of the &#39;90s? Visual Basic, Delphi.
The information was well organized, great video!
the end...
Missed opportunity to mention VHDL and Verilog...
As the video loaded I thought &quot;huh, 175k likes wonder why that is&quot; and by the end I knew.  Take 175k+1 my friend.
You‚Äôre literally my favorite human
You missed microcode between assembly and transistors.<br><br>Most, though maybe not all, epistemologists would say that knowledge is justified true belief, Gettier cases notwithstanding.
Kotlin is the name of the island in Baltic Sea near Saint Petersburg and also before the war Jetbrains have had most of developer force (including Kotlin creators themselves) in Saint Petersburg. So I think it is more Russian than Czech
Most of us started with Assembly.
That was a very climactic and rewarding end. I feel very satisfied that you brought up epistemology. I have no idea what anything in this video was explaining, as a layperson, but I enjoyed it regardless. Especially the climax at the end about the Matrix and Brain in a Vat.

Funnily i learned to code with Assembly and C (yea my teacher was the devil). Then we had a good laugh at VB and learned C++. I thought JS, TS, PHP, HTMLK and CSS myself, as they seemed kinda useful. SQL was also learned somewhere in that period. Somehow got into game design with Unity and learned C#.<br><br>Now I am a fullstack Webdev. TS, C# and SQL are my bread and butter. So in my professional live I am as far detached from hardware as it gets.<br><br>Yet, I love tinkering with rpis &amp; arduinos and lately found a &quot;game&quot; simply called &quot;Tuiring complete&quot;.

man, I&#39;m now co-de-pressed
I&#39;m starting to feel you were high doing this vid
watching this video is exactly what programming in brain f**k feels like, approved.
so which is used for programing nuclear missiles??
I made a programming language called Strike I hope to publish it nearly
I only have issue with explanation of the lowest level. AFAIK there is not difference between ASM and machine code. When I started out in 2008 we learned C first with ASM integration (High school, year 1). ASM being specific to a certain architecture came pretty much with documentation regarding said infrastructure and with clear mapping of ASM commands to machine code. So ASM keywords were pretty much just numbers really just in ASCII representation. Further in documentation there was a circuit diagram so that you could translate those commands directly into &quot;logic gates and wiring diagram&quot;. <br><br>Point was that for every program you wrote, you could calculate EXACTLY how many clock cycles it is going to take, know EXACTLY how the machine state looks in for every clock cycle and where, how and how long the data will be there. And yes I am taking into account memory refresh every X cycles to preserve data stored in it. You could (and one group did) build your own computer from scratch. Soldering and all.
I spit out my beverage at Shitcoin
What about PowerPoint
TBH In the last tier I would include VHDL/Verilog as languages in which you can program a processor onto a FPGA chip, so it would landd between machine code and transistors.

Hell of a video - 10/10.  I don&#39;t know myself anymore.
I loved the vid, but I&#39;m sad that you left out the three main languages for programing PLCs (Programmable Logic Controller), these being SCL, LAD, and FBD. The first is text based similar to python I guess (I have never used python so I&#39;m not sure), but the other two are pictogram based. Check the out sometime, they are used very often when working with automation in factory settings.
Thanks now I&#39;m in my existential crisis modeüòÇ
The moment my brain started to understand lolcode i knew i was spiraling into insanity
I done goofed up and learned C as my first language which was a real kick in the groin but after learning it, stuff like C++, C#, JavaScript, and SQL where a lot easier to learn. I still revert to C/C++ for fleshing out ideas or solutions to tricky problems when I can. Sure I might not be able to include classes in my experimental solutions but a struct and some functions can yield a pretty clear answer that I can reproduce in higher level languages using OOP. Luckily my actual job uses a C++ derivative, AngelScript, so it worked out pretty well so far. Excellent break down and history of coding languages.
when talking about gates i would mention VHDL , HDL, Verilog so the nightmare of programming students, and a scourage to programming langauges

I&#39;m fairly certain I won&#39;t regret not learning PHP on my deathbed.
pascal was my first programming language i learned it in highschool<br>in 2016 xD <br>they switched to python but some schools still use pascal because teachers are too old to learn another programming language so in the national exam we have two prog exams one for python and the other for pascal

this video should have ended with the ultimate language which is the basis for quantum mechanics, the psyche, the soul, that language with which god created the universe, javascript. even for him it took 6 days to complete the project and he deleted most of the code and rewrote is several times.
I started to take C++ seriously in around 2018 or so. It took me 2 or so years to get decent at the language. But honestly, i don‚Äôt regret it at all. It‚Äôs by far the most powerful language. It might not be the most profitable one, but I‚Äôm too deep now to care about money lol

In 2 years, from 1986 to 1988, I reached the top and bottom of this video üòÖ: At the age of 12, I began programming in 1986 using BASIC on a French TO7/70. Two years later, I transitioned to writing 68000 assembly language on an Amiga 500
So well made video indeed. Especially now that I&#39;m reading some books from 80&#39;s and 90&#39;s, I get how those last levels are.
Great Road map
well... that kind of spiraled out of controll towards the end
What about Verilog , VHDL , SystemVerilog üòÇ.

I have started with Basic and Machine Code in 1987....
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pEfrdAtAmqk&amp;t=975">16:15</a> the answer is in India üéâ
once he said transistors i though &quot;where&#39;s verilog or vhdl?&quot;
bro i only asked you for a pencil
Ive searched for COW language with the Moo Moo syntax
Lil bro actually recommended PHP NAHHHH üíÄüíÄüíÄüíÄ

Every self-respecting computer programmer should take at least one semester of C. Not to make a career on it no but to learn to how computer manages memory and why certain data structures are better for certain tasks. This helps a great deal in the future wherever you go in programming. I know C but I work in Python and if you say python is slow then screw you you just don&#39;t know how to use it. There is always NumPy, and if you really want to speed things up you can write a C  extension for that one particularly cpu-intensive task.
Holy moly, I felt dumb before this video. I feel even dumber now and even more in awe of programmers. Wow....
Rust is the only language
Start üòÅ, End üò≥
That was entertaining üòÇ especially the last part.
To get rich quich learn SAP ABAP or COBOL to work on ancient and/or hightly priced niche products. If you like to be universal useful and skilled, learn C , later C++.
Was that a THE CABLE GUY reference?
I might need a tutorial for the last one, like, do I just think of the code?
okey now I have to ask:where do you get all these memes dude?
I&#39;ve been wanting to learn programming for years but never thought it was for me, now I feel it is too late haha, I&#39;m just 20y old, maybe is not for me...
That was fun.
I skipped from web development ( HTML; CSS; JS) and python , c , batch, vbs, to x86 64bit linux assembly....

It&#39;s criminal to mention Scratch, which lacks variables and is not turing complete, without mentioning Snap!, Berkeley&#39;s fork of that turns it into a real language.
Missing is all the unique DSLs. Paradox Development Studio has their own scripting language with no documentation. Playing withe mesh renderer in Victoria 3 to spoof the number of buildings being built so it doesn&#39;t trigger a construction mesh to be triggered an ungodly amount of times every second, was fun. Also, another modder built an entire AI system to determine which building to build and where it would be most profitable. Thousands of lines of code in this simple script (dude has PTSD from some sections of that code and there&#39;s no documentation in sections of their mod because of it, I know this because I added my own economic system ontop of their&#39;s with awhole new ass game concept for it to consider. Dude, is a legend vanilla ai economies only reach about 700mil GDP. Dude got 4 of them to a billion and I got 6 of em there in AI only observed games)  just to get a 1/5 of what was historically accurate from the economies at the time.
I watched this three years ago was totally tripped out, now watching it again three years later i understand about 80% of these languages and am expired to learning how to use them. Who said NZT-48 is limited to a pill lol
this video got phylosophical really quick

My school made us learn C++ as an intro into coding ü•≤
From <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pEfrdAtAmqk&amp;t=900">15:00</a> it&#39;s just an average Assembly programer&#39;s thoughts
The end escalated pretty quickly
I love Python:)
Okay but what do I do after all that?

Does anyone ever learn or know all this languages? Is it even possible? <br>I think now a day for good carrier in programming, all you need is Python, JavaScript, Jave Ruby, C++
I asked chatgpt how I would write &quot;hello world&quot; in the Malbolge language. &quot;it is important to note that it is an extremely difficult and esoteric language that was specifically designed to be very challenging to use. It was created as a kind of parody of obfuscated programming languages, and is often considered one of the most difficult programming languages to learn.<br><br>That being said, if you are determined to print &quot;hello world&quot; in Malbolge, you can try the following code&quot;<br>Lol bot said that last sentence as if it was saying &quot;Hey if you wanna die here&#39;s how you do it&quot;<br><br>(for those curious this was the code: (=&lt;`#9]~6ZY32Vx/4Rs+0No-&amp;Jk)&quot;Fh}|Bcy?`=&lt;dL^$tu*8Y)\:1;[w]sU9{OM&lt;n%`Hf!$rCsu6&gt;7z5m)
Right so theoretically if I was a complete noob trying to choose between Lua, C++, and Nim it would probably be best to go with Lua? Checks out I guess.
Why do I even watch this I have no idea what he is even talking about, but I like it.
Good video but missed opportunity to make the punchline Matlab lol
Are there any ultrachads, who program on NASM?
This is dope!
Just discovered, such a gem of a channel. üíØ
Not gonna lie, I lost it at C-- and holy C. Developers are nuts. lol
God tier programming? Terry Davis
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pEfrdAtAmqk&amp;t=278">4:38</a> i know i&#39;m kinda late, but Kotlin was created in Russia(named after island in St. Petersburg). Jetbrains have HQ is Prague but had huge offices in Russia before February 2022. Then Russia invaded Ukraine and they closed everything in Russia
There&#39;s VHDL / Verilog for CPLD&#39;s and FPGA&#39;s, to program the logic gates and build custom silicon, like bitcoin ASIC miners or other hardware accelerators.<br>FPGA&#39;s primarily used in modern network interfaces, like Mellanox (now Nvidia) and Broadcom, to churn through network traffic right when it comes as a light ray (process known as offloading). Processing data directly onto network interfaces with the help of FPGA&#39;s now known as DPU (data processing unit). For instance, you can host a minecraft server right on you 200Gbit/s Nvidia Bluefield Network Card, by programming an ARM cpu and installing a linux box there.
I missed PostScript and LaTeX.
Fireship needs to stop acting like crypto is a serious thing that you need to know about
In my master&#39;s we were taught how to use Csound. It was a fucking pain to learn coming from JS and Python, but it&#39;s so much better for the audio purposes we needed.

Loved the ShitCoin, would invest.
I was following until about 5 minutes in
When I started at University we learned Modula 2 and Bash in the first year, In the second year I learned C++,C, VHDL and Assembler. In the final year we were taught Ml and  Lisp and my final year project was in implemented C++.You said in your video that C was invented in 1969 and was used to write Windows and Linux? But in reality it was invented in 1972 to rewrite Unix from assembler in something higher.<br>Unix was invented in 1969!
This video really excited me and pointed me in the direction to do what I want and now I have to do better thank you for sharing this knowledge.
I&#39;m currently studying a degree on software dev and I&#39;m supposed to learn Assembly in just a couple months, it&#39;s so stressful.
ok i will never understand how computer works
as always, the deepest layer was my favourite hahaha, thanks again for reframing all of this in some cosmic conceptual thought-experiment fireship.
Bro the coding languages at the bottom are hella good
By the time I learn all these languages it will be worthless
Note: Kotlin is not just used for Android apps, it is generally used to replace Java on the JVM, and it can also do multiplatforming. APL is not just historically important, it is used in data manipulation applications.
Ok... So that was awesome.
you know what could be missing in the god tier roadmap? Physics. it&#39;s like the programming language of the universe itself.
It never ends in philosophy. I graduated my college with a philosophy degree, but I feel like a retard even after one year of coding self-study. The conformal cyclic cosmology applies to programming learning
There&#39;s just no way there are developers in this comment section with all the typos.
I&#39;m 40 years old and started learning C-Sharp but I&#39;m wondering if I can be a programmer after this age üò¢
HTML is not a programming language
I use temple OSüòä
where does the forth programming language fit in there?  It looks like a generalized assembler (not dependent on machine architecture).  I heard about it in the &#39;80s but never got to use it.
first bank I worked for blew my mind how much money COBOL programmers make, all while using a language older than my parents
I figured the deepest code on the iceberg would have been DNA programming, but eh okay
Alhumdulilah , I only know Assembly Language &amp; know how to write programs.

I&#39;m a beginner and all I&#39;ve done is set up an ide and bought a book on learning c++ and now I&#39;m scared
I feel a bit called out by this. Heres a quick simplification of how my programming journey went<br><br><br>I started with html, css, and js<br>Went to python<br>Then c#<br>Dabbled in lolcode and brainf#!k and eventualy got decently good at whitespace lang, even making a small game<br>Then learned c, followed by trying c++ and not liking the slight changes, so istead went other dirrection with c89 and stuck with it instead<br>Attempted to learn haskell but it made brain hurt<br>So instrad i then turned to assembly, 8080 and 16bit x86 <br>And am currently on my venture of studying vacuum tube computers and hopefully designing a small scale one, transistors are too modern<br><br>This was all in the span of ruffly 3 years, currently my main language is C89, however i also use K&amp;R C for some systems if needed and 8080 ASM, both mainly CP/M machines. With that in mind, if i need something done quick and dirty ill use python. And im also highly fluent in batch scripts, dos and windows editions. But less so in bash, and have virtualy nothing in powershell. <br><br>Well thanks for reading i dont realy know why you did but hi anyways
Programming is a total shit‚ù§‚ù§‚ù§‚ù§
KTHXBYE
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pEfrdAtAmqk&amp;t=988">16:28</a> can we go back to SCRATCH please üò¢
Followed up by C# is a bit disingenuous.  Microsoft took Java in the 90s and added a bunch of functionality that would only work in the Java VM they wrote, called Virtual J++. Sun (who owned Java at the time) took Microsoft to court and eventually won, requiring Microsoft not implement Java pretty much ever again. During the time this lawsuit was going on (late 90s to early 2000s), Microsoft took their J++ and created a new programming language called C#. So yes, C# is a &quot;follow up&quot; on Java, but it&#39;s a follow up because a court told them they couldn&#39;t use Java.
Forgot about that programming language called Chicken where all that you can write is the word chicken
This iceberg is really deep lol
Wow thanks!
Hey, I know I&#39;m late but &#39;Piet&#39; is not Pee-et but more like &#39;Pete&#39;. At least, that is how Piet Mondriaan pronounced it; no clue what the programmer did. The &#39;ie&#39; is a long &#39;i&#39;, so like &#39;ee&#39; (need) or &#39;y&#39; (baby) in English.
Good video, but was expecting some Perl love. That language was pretty significant during the dot boom. I know a lot of Amazon‚Äôs stack back in the day was heavily Perl.
OMG, it reminded me of my college days. Programming in Lisp, COBOL and Prolog. Once you survive Lisp, everything looks a piece of cake.
I actually learned Assembly in college, man you making me feel nostalgic
I was expecting you to mention ActionScript which, when Flash was still a thing, you could basically build anything you would find on a desktop app in the browser.
15 years ago I skipped the whole basic thing and jumped right into PHP. I still have flashbacks that send chills down my spine how ridiculously hard it was to pick up lol. Glad I did though, Haven&#39;t used it in the last 5 years but it will always be near and dear to my heart.
HTML is NOT a programming language!<br><br>It is a scripting language and has never met the criteria of a programming language. <br><br>LOL, I&#39;m currently learning a variation of Micro COBOL in order to keep supporting a legacy application for work.<br>I need to ask for a raise. It runs in a CPM based virtual machine!<br><br>PS. I also used to program in 8Bit assembly for the MB Vectrex Console for fun, untill my Vectrex broke a couple of years ago.
How could you skip ABAP‚ÅâÔ∏è

I remember saying that C++ should be called C-- because of how you need an external library for basically anything so I&#39;m surprised that it&#39;s an actual language lmao

PL/1 and Expect.  All ya ever need.
No Verilog or VHDL, both lower than C but faster to write than Assembly.
Hell of an ending!
Java. Code once, DEBUG EVERYWHERE.<br><br>In the final stage you leave the computer and keyboard behind and start working with your mind.
The oasis of knowledge is a mirage in the desert of ignorance.

Quantum programming languages were not introduced. I had a course on quantum programming. It was more mindfuck than any of these languages
Hilarious tour of the nerd world! If it weren‚Äôt for the egos involved, we‚Äôd have had ChatGPT years ago. Now it‚Äôs here and will obsolesce the lion‚Äôs share of workflow bottlenecks which selfish programmers thrive on, because yes, there‚Äôs a God out there who wishes folks would just get along and not keep trying to prove they‚Äôre better than someone else.
I can&#39;t stop watching this vid despite wanting to close it, and zoned out after 2nd teir. mind blown
You forgot about Objective-C, used for Mac programming based on Apple re-incorporating NeXTSTEP into Mac OS X. Basically C with Smalltalk bolted on. And there was Modula-2 (as well as Modula, Modula-3, and Oberon), which was the step up from Pascal with a lot of C principles added in. I loved and still love both languages, and even do a bit of GNUStep programming with gnuC&#39;s Obj-C front-end compiler from time to time. And yea, I&#39;m learning COBOL for real now, the reason I found this vid!
&quot;Pointers&quot; are a reference to pointing at a memory location, NOT a gun.<br><br>Great video

ASSEMBLY
As a man who often program in C, asm is the language i currently worship
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pEfrdAtAmqk&amp;t=164">2:44</a> - Did you include that sentence to provoke people like me to comment? HTML is obviously not a programming language.
I am unironically fluent in Assembly X86. School decided I should take 3 classes with it‚Ä¶

ME ü§î wondering why no Visual Basic mention after I built 10000 line highly functional app for our business
I feel kinda proud just having started my apprenticeship as a IT systems engineer and already programming some small things in cobol
First dabbled in APL at a Coding Camp at the UNSW. Then onto Uni in Brisbane (Qld, Australia) learning Pascal, to train our minds to be logical &amp; organised. Then coding in COBOL on datasheets which were sent to a typing pool, to produce punch cards which we fed into the mainframe. We could then access the programme on a green-screen monitor (usually at 2am, due to the ratio of students to access ports)... etc, etc, etc (in Yul Brenner&#39;s voice)
almost 17 minutes and you blew my mind. omg too much info
I used to call SQL &quot;squirrel&quot;
soy based languages
imagine meeting the psycho that programs using f!&amp;king machine code<br><br>theyre out there
Correct HTML and CSS is not programming languages, but page renders, similar to postscript or even RTF. <br>Despite it can do a few calculations, you can not generate a real standalone app..
Pascal is still being taught in Uruguay&#39;s public university and it&#39;s required to pass Programming 1. To quote some friends that are studying there, &quot;It&#39;s like they force you to use an old rusty blender that no one has even touched in 50 years, and after you¬¥ve learned all it&#39;s quirks and problems you are given a completely new and functional blender and they tell you that you are never gonna use or se that old one ever again&quot;.

Me, who decided learn Python thinking that it is a good idea.
I am currently learning assembly after having learned the basics of C, C++, R and Python in just the first year of software engineering, I wasn&#39;t expectating to be so low in the iceberg that fast.
Bro I just did it backwards
Stuck on tier 3 and dabbled in tier 6. Fight me.
After decades of professional programming my advice is:<br><br>Phase 1 (&quot;How software and computers work&quot;): Learn and use C for some practical projects until your mindset adapts to control yourself your resources, like memory, pointers, handles and all that. Most people think this is something useless nowadays, but I strongly disagree. I did it for years in commercial videogames and prepared me with a really solid base for being more organized with data structures, efficient algorithms, memory optimization and code performance. In this phase you will break A LOT of things, and debug a lot of code, and that&#39;s exactly the point.<br><br>Phase 2 (&quot;How software is made nowadays&quot;): Learn basic OOP, but don&#39;t go too far into its more obscure features. The language in this step is not that important, OOP is mostly the same everywhere. This will give you a new layer of skills for code organization, modularility and reusability. Using a strongly-typed language at this point can be a bonus to better learn about code organization and reusability.<br><br>Phase 3 (&quot;I already know what I&#39;m doing&quot;): Once you know how to organize your data and your code, and OOP is mostly natural for you when you design the structure of your projects, you are in the perfect moment to jump to a loosely-typed OOP language like Python 3 (or Php 8 if web is your thing) and don&#39;t look back. At this point you know what your code does and how your data is structured, so you won&#39;t need a paranoid-narcissistic language (like Java) taking you by the hand reminding you all the time what you can do and what you can&#39;t. At this phase the main point must be &quot;what you want to do&quot;, not &quot;what the stupid compiler wants you to do&quot;, because you are the programmer and YOU are in charge, not the language ;)<br><br>BONUS TRACK: When you will learn the most your trade is by finishing projects, and I mean it. Starting projects is easy, exciting and fun, but finishing a polished project requires a huge amount of effort and patience (and pain and suffering too). Every FINISHED project will level up your knowledge by a lot.
thank for your informative video but your facts have some holes in them now a days its hard to classify a language as (functional or imparatives) java since 6 years suuport functional lambda notation so as c# and javascripts. and how the language support fully or partialy the functional paradigm vs the turing imparatives way. i gotta say your video will not age well later on but anyway thanks again for the video keep it up
&quot;You can do things the hard way or the harder way if your smart you can do it the hard way but 99% of people succeed with the harder way&quot;
finally i have a glimpse an understanding of how this thing works. I never understood how the first code was written so people could code on some coded code and you rubbed my face into the egoic illusional existence so it didnt matter, but it felt good for a second.
So what if I start from the bottom of the iceberg?
That ending was fire üî•üî•üòÇ

So I live in romania, and our school system thinks that in 9th grade you should start learning C++, without any prior knowledge about anything programming related. During the first Informatics class of the year, we started off with LEARNING HOW TO MAKE AN F-ING FOLDER IN FILE MANAGER(which mostly all of us knew already how to do), and two weeks after that, started in C++.
I started with Assembler, I found a world where I could manipulate pulses around circuits and microprocessors DIRECTLY.
lul lul lul
You missed Karl ++
I was a little bit sorry to see you passed on a perfect opportunity to talk about FPGA design languages like Verilog after mentioning transistors and gates, but your digression into epistemology was surely more entertaining!
the end was very inspiring!
Genius. Thanks for making this glorious video.  Epic ending BTW
I know COBOL well, having written entire systems with it a long time ago. I am now a janitor. I am happy.
The 3 idiots hospital picture, I see you.
Time to dive deeper into the matrix it would appear.
I started with assembly when I was 14. And 20 years later I&#39;ve started using it professionally.
You missed Register Transaction Languages such as Verilog and VHDL, they belong somewhere between assembly and transistors, since they are used to arrange gates and flip flops in an integrated circuit.
Me in college learning Visual Basic. Oh no
You just gave me existential crisis at the final part
No VHDL or Verilog - well, the most important ones to design computer hardware
This video exactly reflects how my brain works

I love your humour. Praise be to our lord and savior T.Davis
i didnt even started learning a<br>ny programming language but im already quitting
Another historically important language was IBM‚Äôs PL/I (for ‚ÄúProgramming Language One‚Äù), a mashup of FORTRAN, COBOL, and ALGOL, which was actually quite good in the mainframe environment, except for slow compiling due to its extensive optimization (on by default but could be turned off).<br><br>PL/I spawned a few descendants, such as PL/S (S for ‚ÄúSystems‚Äù), developed by IBM for coding internal operating systems modules (much like C) and  Sabretalk, a stripped down version of PL/I to replace S/360 Assembler for applications to run in an airline reservation system, developed by American Airlines for its SABRE system, later becoming an industry standard for other airlines (but all the program and system building was done on IBM S/360 using DOS/360 and later using OS/360).  The stripped down OS was called ACP, or Airline Control Program, but proved useful for other high performance real-time systems such as financial companies, and was later sold by IBM as TCP, or ‚ÄúTransaction Control Program.‚Äù  The TCP (ACP) operating system, that is, which I suppose must have included the Sabretalk language and compiler.<br><br>Writing control card statements to run multi-step (or even single-step) batch jobs was complex enough for OS/360 (all the way from OS/PCP to MVT), and to a lesser extent for DOS/360, to be considered a language in itself: Job Control Language, or JCL.

opinion: as a developer with good education you will automatically go through each layer of this ice berg. but understanding and using those languages makes you just a good programmer. <br><br>so for all viewers that got intimidated by this iceberg: there is more ...<br><br>to be a good developer you need also abilities in software architecture, software design, process abstraction, documentation, quality assurance,  anti-patterns, ... and many more.<br><br>professional developing is a universe in its own and anything else but easy money. <br><br>and when you look at the AI evolution nowadays (e.g. copilot), the programming itself might step back in future and the skills around programming could become more important.
This video was shit ngl, it listened what makes the programs different but it dosent explain what the terms mean. Like low lv high lv object orientated doing this doing that like bro  Google can tell me  this
I didn&#39;t understand half of the words in the video üëç
Videos that give you a quick roadmap with a hint of nihilism are not helpful. I grew up with computers, I learned how to program when I was 14 because my schools had classes that taught JS HTML CSS and other languages. I did go straight into computer science. I am now a full stack web developer and computer scientist. Seeing this video before my program and after is hilarious because the missing ingredient is time and effort. You can code if you want to you leave your friends behind, and if they don&#39;t code they aren&#39;t any friends of mine. I was early to the party and early to leave and it took me a while to get back to the party and now I&#39;m straying for the afterparty.
I just wanted to know how to make a roblox game what the fuck im seeing
I&#39;m glad I started with C and C++. Moving to other languages from them was so simple.
bro ............. i started learning with c++ lmao and then going back to python and java script n stuff
I started my programming journey but never started from scratchüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ
I absolutely love how I happen to have at least written a classic &quot;hello world&quot; programme (or its equivalent, as you don&#39;t exactly do that in sql) in at least one language in almost every tier of this iceberg, and done so in a completely chaotic order.<br><br>I mean it. The chronological order of my learning goes: python, binary, scratch, html, css, Brainf*ck, c++, c#, sql, pascal.<br><br><br><br>So I had lots of fun watching this video - it&#39;s completely accurate xD
After i watched this Video, i learned Cobolt and got rich
what has Jesus done to you? it&#39;s not nice to mock him like that in the thumbnail. But the video is cool.
How amazing how your portrayed physics as a programming language of the electric particles, which it is
What an amazing sense of humor for creating a whole programming languages for a parody, soo goood

Me at the first few minutes: yes<br><br>Me at the very end of the vid: what the f#@k is this shit
Brilliant video. Technically great, but the idea of going from higher up to all the way down to bytecode is brilliant. Kind of like that famous space video where the zoomin to you sitting in a park, from way up from another galaxy.

What? No ladder logic?
I‚Äôve twice tried to learn Java but it‚Äôs so complicated. I also spent about 6 months learning HTML and CSS, which was just at the right difficulty to be challenging and enjoyable. Then when I went to college the teacher said ‚ÄúYou‚Äôll be learning HTML as well. It‚Äôs so easy, you‚Äôll learn it in a couple weeks‚Äù, which just made me feel really stupid and like I‚Äôd never learn programming, but that was total bullshit anyway.
The programming language is the least important thing to learn in programming.<br>This is what you learn from learning a lot of different programming languages.

Hey you didn&#39;t talk about Rust.....
In college we had to take an IBM mainframe assembly course and we were tested on reading the machine code. Good times.
Solidity is trash. It should go to the garbage pile of history with the ethereum shitchain.
Visual Basic never gets any love.
Wasn&#39;t php invented by a danish guy?
For transistor programming, you an go full Chad and learn FGPA (Field Programmable Gate Arrays) Tech like Xilinx. Saves the trouble of soldering and you can configure hundreds of thousands of logic gates on a single chip. Makes every function execute in one clock cycle. Or for the brave you can run them asynchrously, in which the speed of electricity becomes your fundamental constraint.
God-tier developer roadmap: Rust all the way
I remember in highschool &#39;95 we were using turbo Pascal. It was interesting I just don&#39;t think our teacher understood beyond the very basics and only taught it to a certain point. I wish I toughed it out though.
Don&#39;t know why, but my first language was C++, i love it
What I find almost terrifying is how old some of these household names in programming languages are. That means we&#39;re just a bunch of potatoes. The real geniuses came in the 50s-70s. We&#39;re just breathing their rear ends.
I did my FYP in solidity. <br>Creating a functional payable function was hardest part for me.<br>Then a person on ethereum StackExchange helped me out understanding that how it works.
Awesome!  But I missed D and  Rockstar :(
language is nothing outside the usage context
I thought you would have mentioned  VHDL And Verilog the languages used to design semiconductors at the lowest level.
As a PhD student in philosophy dealing mainly with epistemology and metaphysics I found that starting at the bottom does NOT make it easier.
i started on scratch a bit, quit for a year and then went to batch files where i am lol
Just wrote my first line of code in python(print(&quot;hello world&quot;). Can&#39;t wait to master INTERCAL and make billions!

You forgot <b>batch language.</b>
Programming languages are like Kung Fu style.. they may all look different and are called with different name.. but the basic of Kung Fu is punching and kicking lol!!!
i took computer science in 2008 and learned C and C++. Eventually, got a job in developing apps. the pay was peanut so i decided to jump to a company that design a web. had to learn js and html. it was fun. then the guy that design the ui/ux quit. I had to learn how to website ui/ux design. The company sent me to adobe photoshop, illustrator and ui/ux class. From then my journey as a graphic designer started. Felt in love with it. Quit the website design job and went full freelance doing graphic designs. Last year, suddenly i missed doing programming. since im into Apple Ecosystem, i went for Swift. Love it so much.
I did programming but the pay was shit. I became a doctor, much better chicks and less neckbeardism
In the end ... I rely do not know what to say ... i do not have word man...

Just because you can write it efficiently in something else doesn&#39;t mean doing it in python isn&#39;t going to he easy.

Of course much could be said about any of these and you can&#39;t cover everything, but Golang allows you to do memory management using the &quot;Unsafe&quot; package, including pointer arithmetic. But there&#39;s  reason for it to be called unsafe

Why is AiAhH00ASCA not a language
I learned many years ago with a language called ‚Äújust basic.‚Äù It was next level awful because it would sometimes straight up ignore statements (at least in the free version). I worked around it by copy and pasting important statements 10 times or so. Sometimes that wouldn‚Äôt even work. But it was good enough for me to learn

No &quot;Folders&quot;?
this is a good history class on Programming languages.
... thanks for the video...<br>I shouldn&#39;t have watched this right before I go to bed.
While this was somewhat interesting, I kinda don&#39;t get it. I never had a class in programming. I have been a professional programmer for about 30 years. I don&#39;t know any language well. However, I have used as many as 30 or more in my career. Apps include pacemakers, library search engines, accounting, HVAC, injection molding, aeronautical, machine control, and things I can&#39;t remember. The languages included RPG and PLM that didn&#39;t make your list. Why should I care about the language. I write solutions, NOT CODE. The secret to programming is the ability to understand the customer&#39;s need (better than the customer). And the ability to work against incredible odds.

I learned binary, how to read and count in binary, along with organize in binary and how to make the first blocks. Now I&#39;m studying the hardware so I can start making those blocks and work my way up the chain and take apart coding languages like C and understand how they work on the base level. Along with where print function derives from since that will be the most important function I can ever imagine for making a working text base, without accidentally combining objects using a baseline operating system. when I start doing the higher languages of coding, I rather make the code the tool and not be the tool myself, for not understanding the flags that executes the things that make coding so easy today. that and I wanna know it all like the back of my hand so when I get a career I can pretty much pick up anything or do anything with relative ease from a base machine object coding understanding. even make my own operating systems &amp; languages, which I&#39;m glad I didn&#39;t learn high level coding yet, because I&#39;m understanding the building blocks of those languages, and working on my organization, planning and execution &amp; overall understanding of the system and various parts of the system before I go into assembly so I have a easier time putting all that stuff together from understanding why it works. So, the skills of organizing binary and understanding assembly translates over to planning projects on higher level languages. it&#39;s really fun and challenging, like putting the pieces together and discovering exactly how the puzzle goes together without being told it just works. it&#39;s actually being able to say 2 volts is on, and 4 volts is off.

Ah yes, I never failed to compile html and css in first time
Your video took a drastic turn at the end, but I appreciate the information and your knowledge.
HTML is NOT A PROGRAMMING LANGUAGE. It&#39;s a documentation standard, just like PCL is for printers, only HTML is for browsers. HTML, CSS, Java are all document manipulators not real programming languages at all and not of them are compiled for distribution they all need to be interpreted, so again not real languages at all. They were created to support the desktop publishing from the deficient apple user community.
Damn, maybe Ted Kaczynski was right.
The first 2 rules about garbage collectors are:<br>1) Don&#39;t rely on them to &quot;just work&quot;.<br>2) Don&#39;t trust them.<br>That&#39;s just generally true. See the blow your leg off quote. Just that in this case: That blown off leg might wander off. Raise an undead army, arm it using your credit card and commit unspeakable things in your name. And you first hear about it when you are kidnapped by an opposing faction.<br><br>Which is probably the reason so many don&#39;t even claim to have garbage collection.
i do perl every day at work and i want to migrate to python so bad but we have so much legacy perl code that we still stick to perl.... i hate perl...
Assembler is way too romanticized by the Dunning-Kruger effect.<br>People who actually work with it curse about it jut as much as every other language. Especially the romanticized parts. They might cause flashbacks.<br>Seriously, present self modifying code with a smug face to someone who had to stay sober on new year 2k and they might drown you in your Starbucks coffee.<br>You see, its less about the amount of liquid and more where it goes.<br><br>Also machine code is just less convenient. It&#39;s already just 1:1 translated Assembler so not meaningfully different. Meaning there is usually no reason to write in machine code. The only difference is an even worse lack of readability then assembly. It&#39;s exactly one step worse then removing all white spaces from C code and fulfills the same purpose. Accelerating parsing by a completely insignificant amount of time by decreasing file size. It&#39;s worse because you removed documentation of what is supposed to be executed and what isn&#39;t.

Assembler was fun in the DOS days, before writing an application with it just became a long series of DLL calls (to code that was probably written in C or  C++ anyway).

all i learned is the bottom of the software engineering iceberg is just the beginning of the computer engineering iceberg
Back when I started studying Comp Sci at the university, the first programming course was in Scheme. They didn&#39;t have C in the curriculum, instead, if you wanted to read a C course you had to take the Automation &amp; Systems line course. They HAD a course in assembler.<br><br>The key idea they wanted to drive in, and hard, was that programming is easy, design and e.g. choosing the algorithms is the hard part. It still holds.<br><br>edit: Since I&#39;ve changed fields and do most of the stuff in Python. If speed is a requirement, out come Fortran &amp; C (it most often isn&#39;t, because a good algorithm beats a fast programming language)
What I learned: <br>First-tier: basics<br>Second-tier: crap<br>Third-tier: basics
And also, Kotlin is awesome üòÑ really nice in structure
All tho, HTML is a markup language, CSS is a sheet of instructions for the DOM.
Where is VBS.

I did Business/CIS and Philosophy w/ Ethics and Public Policy as my dual major at Uni... I feel like this video would more easily explained how the inside of my head works than I care to admit. Epistemology is part of the reason I can&#39;t do hard drugs.
This is why I&#39;m glad I stopped at machine code. Assembly was OK, but the rest just got messy.
Nice job.<br><br>Js does everything
The further into the video I got, the more interesting it got. Then I got to the end of the video and felt like I just finished Neon Genesis Evangelion. <br><br>If you made it to the end of the video... Congratulations.
Then you have dependently typed programming languages, which also work as proof systems, where, rather than fighting the compiler to never give you undefined behaviour when you don&#39;t want it, you work with it and determine where undefined behaviour can happen yourself, at the cost of spending an order of magnitude more time writing proofs than programs.

In high school, I learned Java and taught myself html, css, js. In college, as a computer science major, I relearned Java, C/C++, Assembly (Arm/x86), Powershell, and Python.
Today I learned: Low-level compilers make soy-based languages possible.
i hate coding, unlucky i chose it as my path
time to drop out from Computer Science and transfer to Theology degree

You shouldn&#39;t learn languages, you should paradigms. Each paradigm is able to target on problem with a unique approach, sometimes there are multi paradigms languages like Mozart Oz. The clue here is about computer sciences core knowledge, that is the diferent between in the end.

Glaringly, you&#39;ve ignored Hardware Description Languages like Verilog or VHDL which is what digital designers use to design the blocks of logic you talked about to create the fundamental parts of a computer, like a multiplier or adder or memory.
I was taught Assembly at my university. It was such a pain that it was laughable, I couldn&#39;t even hate it. Hundreds of lines of code to make a few led lights in a board blink.

Software development is not about learning languages, that&#39;s very misleading video. The iceberg has a programming language of choice on top, and down go all the tools and technologies that build, test, deploy, and execute them.
Working with assembly make me question my existence...

You forgot about hardware description languages used to program FPGAs. Verilog, VHDL and SystemVerilog.
man here in Brazil we start with pascal
hmm, why did my university make the starting language for fundamentals of computer science DrRacket? That shit was so ass I&#39;m glad I probably don&#39;t have to see it ever again.
Not going to lie, I sometimes still miss the GOTO command in BASIC.
that ending shattered the very fabric of my reality
I still say, PROLOG needs to unalive itself
I haven‚Äôt watched the video yet, but I assume assembly must be number 1 from the bottom
&quot;Binary&quot;.... &quot;1679&quot; That got me.
on the last line you skipped the HDL and variants between assenbly and transistors
Thanks for the perspective view on the programming. Interesting for newbs like me. But you&#39;r not quite right about the philosophy
Glad to see smalltalk on the thumbnail.
HTML got a mention but Verilog and VHDL didn‚Äôt. That‚Äôs kinda sad.
At some point I thought that this video was a joke....
You left out HyperTalk
When I was studying computer science 20 years ago I had to create a new programming language for a class, and the compiler was written in Assembly. My compiler could generate computer graphics and even rendered bitmaps on the screen.
i pretty much stick to Python and C but been working with C++ and QT on a project with a friend in my spare time. I was never a Java fan tryed really hard to get into it but just was not for me.
I don‚Äôt mean to offend any programmers in here but isn‚Äôt using a garbage collector in your language just an admission that you don‚Äôt understand how your code works? If you do, you don‚Äôt need no stinking garbage collection.
15 sec in, assembly has to be at the bottom.
Is it bad im starting with C++?
Not mentioning Delphi is a criminal offense.
What? No VBA?
Wait, did he say, &quot;Soy-based languages&quot;? LOL.
After 12 year I create new computer language
Dude, Ruby dead. Please give some disclaimers before you waste people&#39;s time.

There is one layer you forgot: there is a field in computer science, that is all about making programming as complicated as possible.<br>They&#39;re designed such that writing a &quot;Hello World&quot; program might take years, because there are so many modulos, bit shifts, what-the-heck-do-I-know involved.<br>Maybe make the rule that every fibonacci-numberth-bit must be a zero. Cuz why not.
Take away lesson: Graze whatever languages you find appealing, then find one and master it. Otherwise you&#39;ll end up in a labyrinth of endless loops and quests.
Guys you should really look into the full story of Holy C. It gets wild.
What about CUDA and OpenCL??? O.o
Frontend Webdev Teacher here! If people say HTML is a programming language they&#39;re just wrong. It&#39;s in the damn name: Markup Language. And on it&#39;s own it&#39;s basically useless nowadays.

You have to love to learn to do this job.  That&#39;s the overarching theme.  What you learned today will most likely become deprecated within a few years.  It&#39;s a job of constant evolution, so if you like to turtle this job is not for you.  You MUST change with the times or get left behind.  I went from C++ being the new thing in town with the MVC framework that Visual C++ gave you, to writing React front ends with Mulesoft SAPI, PAPI, and XAPI layers.  Mulesoft is getting old now, so I expect a new maverick to come on the scene and I have to learn a new dialect.  Once you understand programming from the core though, the other languages are pretty easy to pick up.  They all follow very similar patterns.  If you really want to stretch your wings, invent your own high level language, and write an interpreter and compiler/VM for that language.  That will help you understand that languages are just an abstraction to something else and it will make understanding new languages easier.
What about Clipper!? ü§£
delete this kufr I never accept it
Imagine making your own programming language, then just naming it a single letter (A lot of them on this list)
One of the best things about Rust is the absolute Chad of a compiler. Not only does it exactly tell you what went wrong and where it went wrong, it even tells you how to fix it.

The next big coding language will be fundamentally based on how you can interact with and command an AI.
It has been my experience, dealing with dozens of different enterprise applications over the decades, that java applications are inevitably leaky and will crash. C applications are rock solid. I hate java so much that I will not even look at the source code, let alone learn it.

Interestingly, I learned languages in a very chaotic order compared to the layers of your iceberg. Still, it&#39;s true that eventually, most programmers ends up hearing about all of them ^^<br><br>In high school I learned a bit of C++ thanks to an online course but got discouraged when they started using pointers a lot. I took a break to learn how to make static websites in HTML and CSS. I got really into LittleBigPlanet2 and its graphical programming system, even joining an open-source community and helping work on some popular libraries within the game. In parallel I made Ti-BASIC programs on my graphing calculator to help me with my homework, and started making game prototypes using Game Maker and GML.<br><br>While studying for a technical degree I was properly taught Visual Basic, C++, HTML, CSS, SVG, Java, PHP, SQL, SH, PowerShell, and taught myself JavaScript, Python and Dart. I also discovered esolangs and made a Piet interpreter as my final C++ project. JavaScript then became my favorite language because of how quickly I could get results with it (after a very tedious learning process, that I will admit), and because it allowed for a more declarative and functional style of programming.<br><br>Then I studied for a bachelor&#39;s degree and got better at the languages I already knew of while also learning SPARC assembly, Racket, C# and TypeScript and some more obscure ones like CommonLisp, B, SR, ACT-R. I also did a couple projects with the Unity game engine.<br><br>EDIT: and I started learned rust in my down time, and wow I&#39;m liking it.
I was interested in learning some basics just to ask chat gpt to build me some code but I&#39;m so far out of my wheel house. I&#39;m going to ask the guy in the chat to hire me as his farm hand.

I have a technical electronics degree, which I&#39;ve got alongside high school. We learned binary and hexadecimals, then we learned basic logic gates... then C and Delphi (god, delphi is so bad). Then we went to intermediate/advanced logic gate projects. When I thought we were basically done, our last semester had us learn Assembly. I have nightmares to this day
You forgot about Perl and Delphi

A &quot;category&quot; is a collection of objects and arrows (or morphisms) between them, with some specific properties.<br>The statement &quot;A monad is just a monoid in the category of endofunctors&quot; means that a monad can be thought of as a special type of monoid that operates within the category of endofunctors, rather than in a set of elements.<br><br>In simpler terms, a monad is a way to describe a certain type of mathematical structure that has a binary operation and an identity element, but operates within a specific type of category.

I used all of the above mentioned programming languages at one point and time. Just kidding. Scratch and BASIC are my main ones.
I learned FORTRAN 77 first (in the 2010s...) and then taught myself Python out of anger.  I have to say having a bottom of iceberg and top of iceberg spread from the start has made it pretty easy to learn most things in-between.

HTML isn‚Äôt coding. Neither is xml. They‚Äôre just groups of data denoted by tags. It‚Äôs a markup language, it‚Äôs in its own name.
I think the best place to start is 6th form calculus and physics
and then there&#39;s ChatGPT on top of it
Not pictured: domain specific languages. You start with GPU shader languages and end up somewhere much more weird.
You forgot VHDL.
Bro i wish i knew how to code, but it doenst look appealing or even comprehensible to me
I really hope someone makes a full video game from the COD Zombies format. Waw to Black ops 2 was great but zombies went stagnant and even went downwords after black ops 2.  Someone needs to make bigger zombies maps with a more accesable mission instead of those hard to do easter eggs.  I truely beleive an upgraded form of COD zombies would perform well as a standalone game.
Fuck that was interesting.
The best guide about types of programming languages in my life

As someone coming from Physics, &quot;There is plenty of space at the bottom&quot;
Everything just ought to use Perl to be sufficiently DEEP. So deep you skipped it even though the camel logo was shown on the level of  APL, Pascal and COBOL.
As a CS person, prolog is as deep as I went
It is interesting that at some point my existential crisis will be written in JavaScript
And then you didn‚Äôt even talk about plc programming with languages as Structured Text<br><br>Edit : Nice video by the way!
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pEfrdAtAmqk&amp;t=198">3:18</a><br>I have always used LUA and I never knew it was made in the same country I was born.<br>And I also learned it in Roblox.
This is really terrible advice, learn python golang rust and angular/react and ur done.
Either this video was a waste of time or im the depressed person mentioned in the start
Hello the matrix
A relative of mine had to use assembler for his work. He said on a good day, he was able to write 2 lines of functional code with it. And he said it&#39;s extremely powerful for it&#39;s efficiency when it runs.<br>I certainly hope i&#39;ll never have to do that. Allthough i really want to learn and understand it.
As a product designer/manager not coming from a CS background this is soooo helpful. I know HTML and CSS from my tumblr days. and took some Javascript classes, but.... Question for any devs reading this: If I&#39;m working on mobile/web app projects, which language I should I learn about next to be the most helpful to a wide variety of devs?
i feel like, you missed a &quot;programming language&quot; between assembly and transistors, vhdl would be somewhere betwwen there
You need to do a video on the DNA programming language
assembler is actually very fun
you earned my thumbs up right at the end there buddy.
It&#39;s good to hear about Assembly again. I used Assembly to program a 8-bit microcontroller years ago, and i enjoyed it. Made my life with JavaScript way easier.
What about &quot;Rockstar&quot; lang?
My brain is just 0&#39;s and 1&#39;s now. Thank You @Fireship
ahaha masterpiece !
Software Engineer for &gt;20 years. HTML &amp; CSS is a markup language. HTML &amp; CSS is as much a programming language as Google Docs is a programming language ;)  There I said it, bring on the flaming!
Most of these languages lead to dead end jobs. Learn the most popular ones to make the most money:    <br>HTML, CSS, and JS. I suggest you go Web 3  crypto with M0t0k0, which is used by lCP, which is the fastest and most secure and decentralized crypto in the world. It is the only one  that can link up with Web 2 without oracles, and with other cryptos without bridges. Forget about Solidity for Eth, which has most of its servers based in the centralized cloud.<br>If you want to go no code programming, use Backendless with Appgyver for the front end.
As a Software Engineering student who did a semester of philosophy before IT, that epistemology bit hit me so hard.
hello can someone tell me what did he mean by &quot;always bet on JS&quot; at the end? can someone explain the joke please.
how can you forget VHDL at the bottom of the iceberg
BTW, the dutch name PIET is pronounced the same as the english PETE

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pEfrdAtAmqk&amp;t=247">4:07</a> Once you understand how Java types works, you can&#39;t get enough, i absolutely love it. By the way i think there&#39;s one level missing between ASSEMBLY and Transistors, microcode of the CPU
thanks that is cool
I can&#39;t get over the esoteric languages. I mean, what the??!<br>As if this wasn&#39;t what it is already, people actually went out of their way to do that???<br>Too much free time, that&#39;s what they have.<br><br>Dang!
Is it sad I only know the bottom of the iceberg? C++ and transistors.

I was hoping to see Verilog and VHDL at the base of the iceberg
Hey, great video, but am I missing something? I am from Denmark myself so I just want to fact-check this part of the video; C++ was a Danish invention, and not an American invention, right? Maybe it was published in the USA??? Please correct me.<br>From wikipedia: &quot;C++ (pronounced &quot;C plus plus&quot;) is a high-level general-purpose programming language created by Danish computer scientist Bjarne Stroustrup as an extension of the C programming language, or &quot;C with Classes&quot;.&quot;<br><br>I feel kinda scammed by him if he didn&#39;t invent C++, as I have been to &quot;talkshows&quot; with Bjarne Stroustrup...<br>@Fireship

Typescript dev here, currently learning the modern chad(rust) as I will now call it.
we used to program microcontrollers with assembly lenguage in highschool. A few years ago I tried to start programming again with newer lenguages and I felt overwhelm by not having control over the processor banks of memory, clock, etc. I was unsure of everything beacause I didn&#39;t feel in control so I got scared and walk away. Then I try again and a friend tought me how to use C to program microcontrollers. Now I&#39;m learning C# with unity but I still preffer assembly ü§£

Assembly should be at the bottom on its own before binary
People. Don&#39;t listen to this Drama Queen.<br>You can do everything in one language.<br>I&#39;ve been doing APL for 50 years.<br>Again, fireship is just an alarmist Drama Queen trying to get clicks.<br>Ignore her.
If you think blowing your leg off in C++ is bad, just give Fortran a try. It&#39;s as easy to discharge as C and each shot is even more deadly than C++. And yes, it&#39;s still widely used in several fields of applied physics.
it all returns to nothing
For non-tech people who find this video, he uses some terms that might not fully make sense to people who haven‚Äôt heard them before, such as:<br>Low level language: lower level languages are closer to machine code. The lower it is, the less ‚Äúhuman readable‚Äù it is. Obviously people still code with these languages, but really low level stuff like assembly just looks like a bunch of random crap to people who don‚Äôt know it.<br>High level language: on the flip side, these are languages that are further removed from machine language. More ‚Äúhuman readable‚Äù and easier for even the lay person to look at and be like ‚Äúoh, yeah I can kinda see the logic flow‚Äù. Stuff like Python where they replace some logical operators with words and such, are very ‚Äúhigh level‚Äù. The joke ones like Chef would be even more high level since it is literally sentences.<br><br>Hope this helps. I didn‚Äôt notice any other lingo, but I‚Äôm so used to hearing it I may have just not noticed
You really fucked my brain üß†üéá
by your standars God is the ultimate programmer working with quantum logic at sub-atomic particle level.

I wanna see someone code minecraft with brainfuck or binary
meanwhile my school started us all off with c++ lol
All roads end up at epistemology. Great!
meh id rather coders spend a little more time designing apps in languages and stacks they do know rather than failing at everything equally. youd be surpised how much codes looks cool but utterly fails in production, or works but doesnt scale
why no RPG

We know nothing, but we can imagine everything ü§© great video!
Is this voice computer generated? I really hate how there&#39;s no gaps at all where a human would pause for half a second to take a break.
I was going to say that the year of origin for Machine Code was off a bit, not in the 1970s but 1950s, however I watched again and now I see - the year is 1679, went by very fast and I had misinterpreted it as a more familiar 1970-something.   But it&#39;s 1679, and it&#39;s all about Binary, invented or published by Leibniz in that year, give or take a few depending on what sources you read.  <br><br>Maybe.  Herbert Bruderer in an article in Communications of the ACM points out that John W. Shirley a few decades ago pointed out that &quot;...the mathematical papers of Thomas Hariot (1560‚Äì1621) show clearly that Harriot not only experimented with number systems, but also understood clearly the theory and practice of binary numeration nearly a century before Leibniz&#39;s time.&quot;   <br><br>So maybe this video needs an update?
Unless I blinked and missed it, was there no mention of the greatest language in the world, D?  (I may be biased, having just wrote a little useful tool in D.)   <br><br>And what about Forth?  Postscript?   And those obsolete Pascal-flavored languages, Modula and Oberon? And for a brief time in 1997, I looked at Sather - a language few have ever heard of. <br><br>At least one of my other favorites did get mentioned, Crystal, and I liked Haxe a few years ago.  <br><br>To be fair, it goes the other way too - languages mentioned that I never heard of.  V is one.  Recently I found out that in the world of C++ successors/alternatives, there&#39;s one called Vale and one called Val.  And I use Vala, which is great for working on gtk, gobject based software.   V, Vala, Vale, Val - what is going on with the &quot;V&quot; names?

I&#39;ve been interested and always enjoyed programming as a hobby.. but as a kid I didn&#39;t care enough about my future and just skipped school as much as possible (called in sick, did the very bare minimum, etc..)<br><br>Ended up &quot;graduating&quot; highschool without a complete diploma. Then at 22 y/o I realized I should have focused up back then and actually gotten good grades and graduated so that I could go to uni and study computer science.. instead im stuck at 25 doing shit I really don&#39;t care about at all.
man forgot about HDL (hardware description languages) that are used to to describe the structure and behavior of electronic circuits like VHDL and Verilog most electrical engineers learn them
Holy C
this video did make me confused more. but good video bro. lol !!!
This is not a roadmap. It‚Äôs an overview !<br>Fellow programmers, pick one programming language and then start making money as soon as possible! <br><a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23business">#BUSINESS</a> üòÖ

The best language to get a job as a programmer is stackoverflow. Also, I worked in Insurance tech and can confirm that there are about to be a whole lot of vacancies opening up for Cobol positions given the average age of all Cobol programmers I have seen, give it a few years...
Basic is cool. ‚ÄúGo to‚Äù is underrated
Once got down to logic gates... ya missed vhdl...

Wait, C came in 1972. Where did he he get a reference for 1969 ?
&quot;Any application that can be written in javascript, will eventually be written in javascript&quot;<br>I disagree, since we now have web assembly.
Glad c++ was the first language I was taught at university then if it&#39;s supposedly the hardest. It didn&#39;t seem that difficult either but I had a lot of help from the lecturer. I think maybe people find it difficult because they started with a different langauge and then tried to learn C++ as a second. I think when you don&#39;t know anything about programming at all it&#39;s kinda easy cus you have no basis for whats difficult lol.
You missed RTL languages. üòû
Last part destroyed my today‚Äôs motivation
Thank you, I have looked into ELM because I like the idea of it but the Syntax and Structure blew me off at first but at I started to like it. Exciting :) Thx!!
This video is gold
At the end AI will do everything and programmers will no longer exist!

The number of languages alone turned me off from programming. Things are much simpler working at a help desk.
[cue everyone foaming from the mouth and twitching having a seizure on the ground by the iceberg‚Äôs depth]
It&#39;s a small thing, but I really like how he tags in philosophy specifically epistemology at the end without any derision as the &quot;lowest&quot; point of CS. I know its partly in jest, but in STEM I see a lot of people shit on philosophy even though its foundational to literally everything.
In my Micro 1 class, on our exam we had to write C on paper, and then translated into ARM Assembly. Pretty easy‚Ä¶ (that was a lie)
Emojicode is bad but its still better than the emoji movie
wrote some lines in almost all mentioned languages, time to move into philosophy.
You forgot to mention that V is vaporware.
The last minute is my favorite. Great intro into the different levels
im using lua im in middle school its pretty easy so far
Java, c#, and c++ are too deep in. If you study at university you&#39;ll probably take one of those as an intro course
I‚Äôm a fan of Human Languages, I pick them up relatively quick but programming ones are easy as hell to learn but if you don‚Äôt apply yourself it‚Äôs tough. I need to apply myself cause my coding journey isn‚Äôt going too well.

Hate letters, numbers, and symbols? Easy, program with Whitespace.
My first programming experience took place  in 1985. I was bout 15 years old. We had a Texas instruments TI-99/4A computer, which came with BASIC. Then in 1989 I started college and took up Fortran and Turbo Pascal. I&#39;ts been a long long way!
tl;dr: What doth life?
This was a fun rabbit hole. This only lead me to ask: What is &quot;is&#39;?
You have gone toooooooooo dddddeeeep
Now it&#39;s AI
my teacher insisted students should start with Java as their first programming language , I felt like it&#39;d turn away new programmers who never touched code before but it also trained us on debugging thoroughly

You didn&#39;t understand modern epistemology.
Well, everyone is arguing about languages, but it is not language which is important. It how you use them.
This makes perfect sense.... now I know why I prefer C# over C++ .... because I&#39;m a belligerent fool unworthy of my degree and I should stick to developing calculators in Unity.   Fantastic.
wow, I can&#39;t believe some of these exist
Before epistemology you had to say neuroscience
I&#39;ve been wondering for the last two months whether I needed college at all bc I knew if I put in enough time, I could already work in software, but I want the university experience anyway. I&#39;ll be turning this on sometime during CS college when I&#39;m depressed by my life choices to remind me that there are still people in the world who can make me hysterically laugh while watching a programming video

After this video, I want to change my job (web developer)
My college is weird and taught us coding in MatLab. I&#39;m teaching myself c# and did a bit of python too, but I still know ML best
Barely passed my c++ class by the skin of my teeth. never programmed before in my life before that (intro, 100-level) class. Had to take a CS class for my actuarial sciences major, but I&#39;m never taking c++ again. I&#39;m glad to see its down the iceberg a bit so I&#39;m not so alone in my struggle
Literal dumpster fire of a video. You forgot TI-Basic, a super dumbed-down, absolute piece of shit of a language that no one should learn because you can build better things in assembly. The funny part is that on the calulator itself, you can access more memory through assembly than with TI-Basic even though you are using the same IDE and parameters.
Perhaps you have a passion for embedded device design (medical equipment, robots, weather stations/sensors, automotive control, security systems).  You&#39;ll be developing firmware for the ARM variants, PIC32, AVR, etc.  Think kilobytes of RAM and up to 1M bytes of program memory.  &quot;C&quot; is king in this space and in most cases the compiler is freely available.  Sometimes C++ is available.  A step up from there is the Raspberry Pi, NVIDIA Jetson, and ASUS Tinker Board; quite a few more programming languages are available.
How dare you call HTML a programming language ;)
Wait c++ is danish right?

I learned OOP on LPC, created by a graduate student for the purpose of developing MUD. Back in the 90&#39;s, in was a more powerful and higher performance language than Java, so I was not impressed with Java when I started learning that in college. C/C++/C# were much better languages and easier to learn after my background in LPC.
well, that was an unexpected ending
I started as c++ programmer.
This video sent me into a spiral
haha imagine learning assembly before python in engineering college
This went from programming to exurb1a really fast.
I usually program in: Java, C++, C#, Javascript and of course HTML, CSS and MYSQL for web development lol
my school be like: Isn&#39;t programming cool? <br>Yes.<br>Ok nice. Here is C++ have fun learning it, test is in two weeks.
yeah that&#39;s why you never go from the high level to the low level, you always start in a level and go up from there, otherwise... you end up questioning your own existence
that was the best conclusion to this video that there ever could have been
Perl?
Ah yes the lowest programming language: brain
I had to learn assembly in university, so i could program a microcontroller from the 80s.
I inherited a Pascal application. Last time I used Pascal was in the late 80s-early 90s in my high school programming class. And the person who wrote it put all procedures in one file.
What&#39;s funny is the top of the iceburg looks just as confusing from the bottom. Having learned C and assembly first, it&#39;s more frustrating to sift through libraries and docs than just solve problems. Also, you never dropped the Verilog bomb. The layer below Assembly is HDLs. Instead of coding directly on the machine, you code the machine itself.
I did C++ at Uni for 2 years, I winged it somehow. At the end of the course I had very little idea of what C++ was, or how to use it.<br>15 years later, I actually completed a C++ tutorial book and was most proud with myself, I had a better understanding. I thought; this it is baby, I am going to get a programming job, then I discovered the iceberg and my hopes and dreams were somewhat dashed. Today, My mind is not as agile, shall we say. I shy away from complexity. I just want a simple life. I will leave the complexed challenges to those who love mental masterbation.
hahahaha wooooow! What an amazing video, bro! Appreciate it some much! You are my dear brother whoever you are ;)
holly C sounds like a good choice for a religion, i&#39;m wonder how the bible would looks like

lol the ending
brooooooooooo
Actually this is not a roadmap. What he did, he just mentioned what he heard so far..... He doesn&#39;t know about practicality.
Not sure I&#39;d put everything in this structure for the ice burg.  The first language i learned was a variant of asm.  From there, I learned common lisp and c/C++.  Then I picked up python for scripting and worked with a large swath of languages in the enterprise domain.  Right now, I write most things in elixir and rust (both pair up really nicely via NIFs).  On occasion, I&#39;ll also use c and lisp as well as dart for mobile.  When I am forced to write front-end code, my weapon of choice is clojurescript or elm (though these days I use reason/bucklescript over elm).<br><br>Stay away from v; they claim so many things, but the compiler has tons of holes in it.
I think that ending was completely unnecessary but good video
Started with C at high school and then C++. At university only C and then some Python for project they didn‚Äôt taught us because ‚Äúit is easy‚Äù. So even at the end of my studies I never learned in reality to program in Python, when I need something I search on internet end everything works. I program better in C than in Python, and I prefer to use pointer and do extremely powerful stuffs in C rather than use Python which for me is like a toy language üòÆ
Fact: Programming Language came way before computers.
please turn off my laptop if i di
Imagine if we were all chads like Bjarne Straustrup
Xd The first language i learned is c sharp
Sad that you didn&#39;t mention hardware description languages, after all, they are a major part of CS/CE world, and stands right between ASM and logic gates
The neglect of VBA makes me sad as a VBA veteran
I&#39;ve learned x86 and x64 assembly for reverse engineering and these logic gates for electronic. Being sincere, it is not that hard, but you must to have a lot of knowledge about computers, memory management and so on and be able to map many information on your brain at the same time. <br><br>Today I am a 18 years old man and an entrepreneur starting a cybersecurity company.
It got really deep at the end.
With programming, the more you learn, the less you know.
thought people were in my house, just talking in the background of the audio, scared now.
HTML is NOT a programming language. Full stop. Its a markup language.
Scratch sucks
that became dark pretty soon
Horrible video. I&#39;ll know to tell anyone I know to steer clear of Jeff Delaney for coding education.
I kinda wanna make my own programming language now... using macros in C. Chef sounds great
Best part was the ending philosophy
As an electrical engineer I warn you : DO NOT ENTER THE LAST LEVEL , IT&#39;S NOT WORTH YOUR SANITY!!
I reached the bottom level when I was 18.. it made paying attention in my physics tutorials difficult as I didn&#39;t know if logic or mathematics had any basis in reality...<br>Also I learned Brainfuck before Javascript. Yeah I&#39;m a weirdo lol.
Knew a guy in college that could code in brainfuck.  He was weird.
I just wanna learn dart and call it a day
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pEfrdAtAmqk&amp;t=633">10:33</a> I taught myself COBOL a decade ago, as we had hired a team lead experienced in it. (He was an architect for state government infrastructure.) I thought it was interesting how different it looked, and had macro‚Äôd out most of my workday at that point.<br><br>Today, I get the most boomer Web 1.0-Gen recruiter messages. If you ever want to troll, just say you know COBOL, Fortran, (and Fivetran. :) )
Damn, I&#39;m a beginner and started with java.

I love this video so much
C-- is far from esotheric, it&#39;s used at one of Haskell compilation stages (by GHC at least)<br>The list lacks Forth, cell automatons (rule 110), lambda-calculus, combinatory languages (like SKI-basis, iota and jot), and the whole class of proof assistents (Agda/Epigram/Coq/Idris/Lean etc.) which are programming langs too
If you are a brazilian, Lua will always be a gigachad for you even if you haven&#39;t coded a single line in it

Chef doesn&#39;t look silly now.
If you are on the noob level but want to go all the way down to logic gates there&#39;s a course for that called Nand 2 Tetris.<br><br>It starts with high-level electronics design (start with NAND gate, don&#39;t lay anything out on chips, but design the connections and main architecture), then goes from the bottom of the iceberg to about middle. Memes aside I do highly recommend it. I&#39;ve been coding before taking it, it was not super hard but I did break some sweat, since than I have an understanding of how all of this fits in and what ACTUALLY happens after typing print(&quot;Hello World&quot;) clicking compile and run. Before that I had no clue except for knowing bare definition of Von Neumann architecture.
you forgot about CSS and HTML, didnt you ? üòÇüòÇüòÇ
I only code in Holy C, just as St. Davis intended
You forgot matlab, but i guess it is very much like Julia
I miss working on old crap like AMOS basic and general basic on Amiga&#39;s  in the late 80s early 90s..  üòÅ
It&#39;s so funny to me that people are always chasing the shiny new language then they get out of school and all of the job listings are looking for COBOL and Java because the old tech companies refuse to update their legacy systems. Anyway this video was a masterpiece, especially that ending. I&#39;m always trying to tell people that meaning isn&#39;t inherent in the universe!

The first programming language I learned in College was Java, (hated it cause my professor held my hand through the whole thing so when i got into advance level java programming, it was hard and had to relearn it twice) then i learned HTML, CSS, and Java Script. (that was a lot of fun) after that I learned SQL and promptly forgot about it. Then I graduated, Started to learn python on my own, got distracted, and was certified in Ruby.  Now I&#39;m learning Stick.<br><br><br><br><br>as in stick welding.

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pEfrdAtAmqk&amp;t=698">11:38</a> I physically recoiled at this part. I F***ING HATE PROLOG with a BURNING PASSION
another language that came out this year... but has 1958 attached wtf???
Abap all the way
When &quot;YOURSELF&quot; dropped I broke down. Leading to my first ever comment on this very famous website Youtube.
You skipped over the FPGA languages a bit... stuff like Verilog HDL, SystemVerilog, and VHDL.  You did say logic gates, but these languages are a bit more than just the gates.  The conceptually difficult part of &#39;programming&#39; with them is always keeping in mind that everything basically happens at the same time, that your code is not executed line by line per se.
What do you mean &#39;please&#39; doesn&#39;t do anything?  My understanding is that the code doesn&#39;t work if you aren&#39;t polite, and also doesn&#39;t work if you&#39;re excessively polite.  So it makes it work :P
What he says about Cobol is totally correct, it&#39;s the reason my university started teaching Cobol again (demand for devs from corporations).
I mostly just C, and dabble in C++.  But C does do some object oriented stuff to a degree... structs and classes are literally identical except that classes default to private and structs to public.  Also... the pointer and memory management are totally a major part of C, in fact you have to do it in C more than in C++.  The trouble in C++ is that you can cause all sorts of other confusion.  Oh, and macros suck.  If you&#39;re ever even thinking of using macros, then you&#39;re doing it wrong, quit coding now.
Seems straightforward enough...why do I smell smoke?
Basically you can see that it is not an iceberg... But different tools for different purposes, don&#39;t get scared by this video, if you like programming do a favor to yourself and keep practicing everyday.<br><br>I&#39;m a software developer that started from nowhere, after 7 years I&#39;m already living in another country and have a good life. I&#39;m not rich, but I&#39;m happy and have a comfortable life. And I study programming almost everyday.<br><br>My main language is Python, I&#39;ve been through C, C++, Lua and Go, but what brought me here was my capability of solving problems, not the languages that I know, for that, there are documentation and courses.<br><br>Stay hungry...
I will only take the advice given at the end of the video and bet on JS, to never lose.
Learning prolog in 2021 was fantastic
Ansi C FTW. (Yeah &#39;m old :D)
That book from Rodney Zacks was my very first programming textbook...
Wtf? In romania we start learning to code with c or c++ depending on your highschool but aparently they&#39;re  one of the hardest coding languages???????<br>Hell is a state of mind

Thank for this great video.<br>I missed &quot;Ponylang&quot; though...
Dart is also functional language
Cant we just use English
The biggest feature of Lisp is user definable syntax since the syntax is made of Lists which can be manipulated before evaluation. You can grow the language from a handful of primitive forms and keep growing it to meet your problem space.
You covered sooo many languages, but you missed FORTH which was huge in the 1970&#39;s and 1980&#39;s especially in control systems. The big daddy was polyFORTH (USA)

I stopped at 9 minutes. Like wtf. To hell with coding. I&#39;m gonna go work on my mix tape and be a rapper instead.
Appearently you nevert about FORTH which makes your overview - still nice - but incomplete ;-)

Thankfully I&#39;ve stopped programming career and become a farmer with a some automation with my Raspberry Pi and my beloved Free Pascal. No more stupid and painful to read Javascript and Python codes with their new libraries and framework for every week. Love Object Pascal, it just works, fast compile time, fast run time, compile anywhere, even for JVM or even transpile to JS, and easy to understand, like typing a poem, Object Pascal is the best. Just me, my rice field and Free Pascal. What a beautiful life in a countryside without a noisy office and endless new framework learning.

HTML is not a programming language.  I programmed for over 40 years and retired, so I cancelled myself.  HTML, CSS and JavaScript together make a programming language.

You made a very interesting and informative video. Really fun to watch. Until <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pEfrdAtAmqk&amp;t=975">16:15</a> when you spread poop everywhere with this Kant BS.<br>&quot;Reality only exists within your own mind&quot;? Wow. I hope your mind never stops working otherwise all things will disappear.<br>&quot;The external world is illusions and projections&quot;?  No need to look both sides before crossing the street then.<br>You make good videos, but you suck at philosophy.
I didn‚Äôt hear anything Ajax
Everytime I think I know something well, I watch this video to humble myself.
if you‚Äôre going to program, you‚Äôll use python, anyways, i have some tips for some script commands in python<br>1. print(), prints any object or value of the variable, variables are stuff that you custom that can have orders names, and values, so print() only prints text only if you dont use ‚Äú‚Äù. If u use ‚Äú‚Äù in the () and put inside text, it‚Äôll actually make text.<br>2. import time, chose import time, because it‚Äôs the simplest way to delay control flow, which is REALLY useful, it basically allows you to use time.sleep() which you can put a number inside the (), if you do so, it‚Äôll delay that amount of numbers, it‚Äôs like putting the number in and it converts it in to seconds.<br>3. time.sleep(), like 2, if you put the number amount in the (), it‚Äôll take it as seconds, and delay that amount of seconds.<br><br>and if you are stuck with what IDE using, i recomend Visual Studio Code, because its the most understandable out there, watch a tutorial how to download that, it has extensions, even python! So i recomend Visual Studio Code more than any one else.<br>If you want to program and have a IDE, i recomend Python if you want to take it low level, or if you have more things to program, i recomend lua. both downloadable in extensions!
HTML is NOT a programming language, it is (like the name hypertext MARKUP LANGUAGE says) a markup language. HTML is NOT turing complete, it is only a way to represent data.
Aight, f*{k this shit! Lol
THANK U BOSS!
I dont&#39; think Irony means what you think it means.
This is one of the best videos on programming I&#39;ve seen on this platform. That monad joke was perfect - even if you fully understand them, good luck explaining it to anyone else.
Why did you mention Vietnam at the end though? LOL, is it just random or ?
i think im gonna stick with english
me watching this video, only knowing the some of the languages at the top of the iceberg: Tf is this?
Scratch is RAD. Garbage

The bad thing about this video is that you can&#39;t erase it from your mind to rewatch like the first time, until Elon Musk launchs that feature with the Neuralink
As a ABAP developer I always feel sad being left out.
Lol GO a high performance language. It is ionly high comapred to python. it is still slugish compared to C++ and Rust
I always said that the label full stack developer is absurd. A full stack developers would need to at bare minimum be able to  write his own operatign system, compiler,  drivers, the browser itself, the data base (write it, not use it), the protocols, then only the easy stuff of backend and frontend.
&quot;BHAI LANG&quot; not mentioned
I did not expect this to go lower than logic gates, the one following it made me audibly ask &quot;What?&quot;
I&#39;ve always been a huge fan but after this video I turned into an air conditioner
i only knew haxe in modern languages
Always disappointed when I don&#39;t see RPG included in these lists lol. Then again, it is a platform specific language

He put Perl on the list, but have not talked about it, so we would think about it! Well played.
There are other programming languages ‚Äã‚Äãbesides C
Watching a video about programming to help decide what language to use and end up having an existential crisis... Yeah, this is just my typical day.
How about Perl!?
A job that pays you well to die sitting at the computer fulfilling someone&#39;s dreams. And yes, a few start their own businesses, and most of those fail.

You forgot the most god tier language of all, MUMPS.
You tried to excise us HumanitiesHeads, wrote language after language, ridiculed us as not important, and where did that lead you? Right back to us.
My first language was C.
What about Verliog and SystemC?
After 30 years a learned several things at about 80 words per minute :-)  Thanks for the tour!
C++ was my first language &gt;,..,&gt;&quot;<br>Everything else seems easy when you learn that one first lmao
You missed the hardware design languages like Verilog
Great video!
A moment of silence for Terry A. Davis.
Lol the first programming language I learned was (forget exact name) but it was an even more basic version of BASIC for PICAXE microcontrollers ‚ò∫Ô∏è
This was a wild and accurate ride; well done sir! Only major omission I could think of was declarative languages like XML, JSON, YAML, TOML, INI etc. I guess you could kinda lump those in with the other &quot;Specialized languages&quot; like HTML/CSS
Me starting programming: &quot;I wish I had started this stuff twenty years ago!&quot;<br><br>Me watching this video: &quot;I&#39;m glad I waited until I was already a psychonaut.&quot;
I‚Äôll forever love and hate fortran. <br><br>When I started college in 2019 I was a physics student, but we had to learn a bit of programming which was done mostly in fortran. I had absolutely no programming knowledge, so it was hellish to learn. However, it made realize my interest (and later passion) for computer science and motivated me to change majors
I just love this video, thx
soy based languages lmao
The first language I learned was TI-Basic for my calculator, and now the programmable calculator I have uses Python
I&#39;ve tried Assembly. That&#39;s the deepest I&#39;ve ever been.

JavaScript is not a high level language. It is a client side scripting language that adds dynamic qualities to DOM elements.
Yeah<br>It&#39;s really scary when I do this it goes to all languages.

They thought me FORTRAN on the first year of engineering. It was 2010, and I absolutely loved it.
Huge chunks missing... And I do not mean &quot;random languages&quot;, but types of languages!<br><br>- Verilog, VHDL, and so on? They are really down the rabbit hole below or around assembly and define the HW!<br>- FORTH and other stuff where you basically can script the compiler and such trickery.<br>- Languages and programming systems used for mathematical proofing the code you write (there are bunch and for the most sophisticated ones prooving is semi-automatic...
Should have added hardware descriptive languages.

First semester cs stundent here. We‚Äôre using c for our normal programming stuff like sorting algorithms. Also we‚Äôre learning arithmetic logic and will soon start programming MIPS in assembly
I like your funny words magic man.
How about FORTH and LOGO?
i am about to start programming but when i see the holy c it makes me that i really wanted is to be a priest.
Would Carbon be a good place to start learning a lower level language instead of C++ or would not knowing C++ make it difficult?
Using a terminal and programming with bash are 2 very different things...
Once you learn programming, it&#39;s only a matter of time before you start to wonder what programming language reality is coded in. <br><br>Then the more you ponder that, the more you find out there&#39;s competing programming languages in IRL too!
great vid!!! ..It would be nice another similar video about coding &quot;best practices&quot;!..
god save me!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
This video is &quot;Fine Art&quot;.
My head aches
I wish I&#39;d learn Rust but my work literally doesn&#39;t require me to use it at all four the foreseeable next 3 years so I just can&#39;t justify it to myself
I&#39;ve been working on the Martian Communal Spaceship since 2002, and all we need to function properly is Scratch and Python 2.0
Ragnarok online&#39;s proprietary GRF format. :)
Maybe it&#39;s because my first &quot;real&quot; programming language was RCA 1802 machine language I had to hand assemble, and as such I have code in orbit... But whenever people call C a &quot;low level language&quot; I have to choke back the urge to bash somebody&#39;s face in.<br><br>It&#39;s like when certain f***wits out there say C is &quot;closer to machine language&quot;... what a steaming pile of BS.

My brain hurts after watching this video x_x
I haven‚Äôt even fully dug the 1st part.
Awesomeness  :)
Im a C++ Guy personally, and I died laughing with both memes of C++, Thank You. Also (I havent finished watching the video yet, so i apologize in advance if you touch on this) you should look into the &quot;Jai Programming Language&quot; Created by Johnathon Blow (Creator of Games: Braid, and The Witness) Hes developing it as a replacement to C++
The first language that I learned is C++, and this made me cry
During the first year of university, we started with C then in next years we had learnt MIPS(assembly i guess), SQL and Python. But without practice(project) learning process is missing
God-tier ending

&#39;For many, the Game of Life was simply a programming challenge: a fun way to use otherwise wasted CPU cycles. For some, however, the Game of Life had more philosophical connotations. It developed a cult following through the 1970s and beyond; current developments have gone so far as to create theoretic emulations of computer systems within the confines of a Game of Life board.&#39;

There are different concerns managed by different languages, and their programming paradigms that each languages aims to provide.<br>With concerns we have system languages which address needs close to the hardware...<br>There are specific oriented languages like SQL ... or Erlang.<br>There are other languages which manage more like business oriented language a problem... Java or C#<br>There are general languages like C, C++ and Java... I consider today Java more an enterprise platform....<br>There are more web oriented languages like Javascript.... and frameworks like AngularJS, etc.<br>And finally is important to remember that software stacks upon itself and generally what we have is a mixture of all above, pile in a specific order....  operative systems, databases, application software.... and there are many side software-tools around the mix with security software, integration platforms, user interfaces, automation software, standalone clients, etc, etc, etc....<br>This is my opinion.<br>I just mentioned because that iceberg image makes quite to think into a kind of climbing mountain, to go through but in reality, you can work with an x group of technologies and only work with that regarding your solutions.

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pEfrdAtAmqk&amp;t=920">15:20</a> It&#39;s not correct to say that one transistor represents one bit. I think you mean that the state of one transistor can be represented by one bit.<br>In circuits, one bit can be stored in a latch, which contains more than one transistor. Or be stored in transistor + capacitor, but it requires permanent energy supply. And maybe something else, but not in a single transistor.

Back when I was an electrician I partook on the revamp of the baker berry library at Dartmouth campus ( the picture in the video) they use a lutron lighting system up in the very top of the tower above the belfry. It can be programmed to do different things. And each big ass bell has a an actuator with a hammer so someone can sit in a room on a computer, pick a song or melody and the bells will play, it was a coll job.

In the early days of the FNF modding scene, everyone wanted to make mods, and just a simple sprite, song and chart swap wasn&#39;t hard, but one mod that basically towered over all was the Whitty mod, &#39;cause it had custom names, 3 songs and the week was added onto the other weeks, instead of being a substitute of one.<br>To make something like that, being that the main game was all in a .exe, I tried to modify the source code, knowing nothing of Hexe, and little of code in general. I actually got pretty far, but I couldn&#39;t modify the sprite offsets and I couldn&#39;t compile the project on my old pc. I guess it wasn&#39;t meant to be. maybe I&#39;ll finish that mod sometime.

Just pointing out, as a physicist and developer,  that quantum computers don&#39;t rely on quantum electrodynamics (QED). This theory is a generalization of Quantum Theory, basically including relativistic effects, though this is the theory that best matches reality right now, regular old quantum theory is a good approximation for every relevant phenomena inside a quantum computer. Just like newton physics is a good approximation for bridge building though in reality everything is made up of atoms.<br>Bear in mind this is not nit picking, QED has nothing to do with quantum computers and people will scratch their heads if you bring this up in this context.

More complete than expected, which is good, but also skips things like Perl and the popularization of regular expressions in favor of covering more esoteric historical footnotes.

Hmm, I switched from c++ to java as my preferred programming language and always saw it as &quot;c++ with garbage collection (and less pointer hassle)&quot;. If I i want to program dirty I choose Perl as the language to go with, even for cgi scripting for websites (php is for girls). Speaking of websites, yea HTML, CSS and JS ara also things I have to deal with. Basic, Assembler (seems it is called Assembly now, da** Millenials), (Parallel) Fortran, UCSD and Turbo Pascal, Logo and Modula 2, SQL are also dealt with in ye olden days.

The thing about trying to become a programmer is that it is never only about learning to &quot;code&quot;.   Coding within a single language will permit you to function within your own sequestered world, but if you want to play with others, you are required to learn all sorts of peripheral support languages, and design strategies.   I started with Sinclair Basic back in the &#39;80&#39;s just to get my toes wet,  then took the plunge underwater to learn C, which is not that difficult.  I proceeded into Objective C to write iOS apps, and eventually came up against the barrier of the peripheral data exchange languages.   Thats where I lost my motivation.   The program I was building was already out of control due to a lack of proper design knowledge,  requiring me to start over, and learn a whole new set of disciplines.    Programming requires a structured learning path, that is best implemented by the guidance of knowledgable and experienced instructors.   Attempting to learn the necessary tools and design principles on one&#39;s own is a sure invitation for bewilderment and frustration.

No, people don&#39;t chose Python because it lacks semi-colons. They choose it because you largely don&#39;t have to import a lib to do large number math, and because there really great user base with really great libs that simplify most things at the right level.
i absolutely fucking despise Prolog<br>i can make logical connections on how to make a program, but when i get to writing it, nearly nothing makes sense
Always bet on JS, you never lose. Wise words indeed..
lulz he say solidity
I want someone to make a language that sort of feels like programming in C# or Kotlin, but is a TOP (type oriented programming) language, that forces you to fully define the range allowed by each type wherever a type is specified as the type used/required. So you can say that a type is &#39;int&lt;1, 3&gt;&#39; (for an int in the range of 1-3), but you can&#39;t just say &#39;int&#39;. The idea is not to conserver memory, but to express all the valid states that can be used and can actually work correctly without crashing the program or making it do something buggy. It would not allow empty arrays or empty strings, instead you would use null for that. When using strings you would have to clarify what lengths are valid and stuff like that.
You can&#39;t forget about VHDL/Verilog
I program using the heat of discrete asceding steps in entropy in the universe. Yuo wouldnt get it

Once in a while I think about the old &quot;html isn&#39;t programming&quot; - it&#39;s 100% true. But Kinda feel like we should be taking about another term like &quot;development languages&quot; rather than strictly programming, cause many devs spend more time on html than programming and it is a form of declarative development.

Poor Julia, this programming language was never mentioned.

Post of these aren&#39;t even programming languages. You&#39;re including query and scripting languages. Difference between programming and scripting languages is in what &quot;format&quot; the code &quot;rests&quot; in on disk (when it&#39;s not actively loaded into a Process). A scripting language resides in the scripting language on disk, and is compiled to byte code for a specific instruction set at run time (called Just-In-Time compilation. But there are gray areas here like anything. C# and Java but use JIT compilation, BUT it a different way than you might think). A programming language will be compiled to the instruction set and reside on disk in an executable format for the specific OS. Benefit to scripting languages is portability across OSs and processor instruction sets. Programing languages don&#39;t require an interpreter though (the interpreter is what compiles the scripting language), so they&#39;re faster. But they also require more work on your part (compilation is just one part. Unless you want to reinvent the wheel, you&#39;re probably want to use external libraries which will require an additional stage after compilation called linking. And it&#39;s the linker that actually creates the executable.<br><br>Query languages are technically scripting languages, but their syntax resides mostly in functions in Set Theory
Impressively complete, Yet somehow managed to completely miss Verilog and VHDL. You know, those languages used to design pretty much all actual modern computers themselves.
ima stick with learning c# but im definitely going to learn rust and c++ after
Gonna put on my resume brainfuck as a programming language
I started learning programming with Python, I thought it was the best language in the world.  Then, at the university, we studied C on the subject of programming, initially it was not easy, I think pointers were the most difficult topic to understand, but after sitting in front of the editor and practicing, I understood how it works.  As a result, my favorite language now is C++.  And I sincerely don&#39;t understand why people think C++ is so complicated... (About pointers, I fell in love with them so much that when I was learning Java I missed them wildly...lol)
This video went a bit too deep in the iceberg :/

You forgot the VHDL and Verilog languages
I expected VHDL and Abel to be put somewhere near logic gates. They are, I believe, called &quot;logical&quot; programming languages. You program things like FPGA&#39;s with it. The thing to remember is that &quot;all your statements are executed at the same time&quot;, and it is helpful to think of your programs as descriptions of logic gates connected together in s certain way.

skipped right over the very real hardware definition languages: VHDL, Verilog. When Apple makes M1 chips, they are using hardware definition languages to design what they send to the world&#39;s 3D Chip Printers (TSMC, Samsung, Global Foundries).  And at the ultimate level; near these hardware definition languages.... everything is made of NAND or NOR gates if you wish.  Memory is feedback loops in circuits.  This isn&#39;t frivilous either; because that&#39;s what&#39;s going on with FPGA programming.
philosophy n math, i think we need to create a new language for the math, why base10?(decimal) or binary, when u try to use other base number mindset daily it will really effect on how u think n view the world (but dont use other base with the intepretation point of view of decimal base, but use the other base in native way), vrymndfck, its like being teleported into other realm

Well time to start learning brain fuck sounds promising
man I just wanna sell my pc
Where was FORTH?<br><br>Disappointed!!
I was just going to finish my programming course but instead I just forged all my certificates and started sending out my CV... thanks!
&quot;Always bet on JS, you&#39;ll never lose.&quot; Yes.
C++ without fear is the scariest book i own.
I have no idea what any of this means but I was entertained throughout the video thank you!
That was great, surprised no mention of Forth, which is surely both unique and has (had 80-90s) a dedicated bordering on religious following
Fuck.... I chose Java as my programming language
Great video!! Love how you ended it!!
Near the end when you got into the deepest part, I started thinking &quot;this guy&#39;s done DMT surely&quot;, then you said that bit about ayahuasca and only confirmed it hahaha üòÇ
Well this was an unexpected collab with exurb1a...
what an effort you made to create this video even if its worth the dustbin.
is it normal to learn binary at univ and there is that much modern languages
I expected a roadmap of things you should learn in sequence like maths, backend/frontend/scripting languages, SQL, networking, etc. But all I got was like most garbage on youtube, a comparison of different programming languages. Misleading title m8. The video was just all over the place. Yet the title says developer roadmap. You couldve just told us learn SQL for database handling, Java for backend, javascript+bootstrap for frontend, read a book like Design Patterns, SICP, Computer Networking layers, etc.
This is like that meme where the mind just keeps getting more and more electrified and in the end it&#39;s just noise and fuzz and darkness. This was beautiful
Lol
ArnoldC for the win
&quot;Or maybe I just never came out of that Ayahuasca trip ten years ago,&quot; Lol
Holy shit<br>The esoteric languages and everything after that was a blast!
okay, but how are these languages created?
Moral of the story, learn Javascript.<br>Got it
It&#39;s not a road map. It&#39;s a road to hell. It&#39;s not God-tier. It&#39;s satan tier to enslave programmers.  Professors and expeets: this is the holy grail for you: Invent minimhm sets of ptogramming-languages to write source-code solving ANY and ALL programming-problem. Does four colour map theorem ring a bell?
what languages would be recommend for someone doing cyber security.
The shader languages would be feeling really sad right now if they weren&#39;t too busy playing golf
Malbolge is what I used to think programming was like as a kid
Why is carbon made in 2025?
If you&#39;re learning this it&#39;s already too late
In school 15 years ago, we learned programming with Comal, it was the pure horror...
No mention of Latex üòÆ‚Äçüí®
omg the end made me flashback so bad :&#39;-]
How can you write backend code with only js and python?
I can tell you another interesting one my Brother introduced me to: C sound.
as a university student, after learning the basics of C, i have tried to learn OCaml, a functional language. Even with a decent enough level of abstraction most people failed the subject, it was really not beginner friendly and i do not recommend it, especially due to the lack of info there is about the language
&quot;reality only exists in my own mind&quot; Actually, epistemologists have more or less concluded that one can only think, that is, at its base, perceive anything at all at the most primitive level, if both the mind and the external reality exist simultaneously.<br><br>Even if there were a perfect magician, or a brain in a vat, or the perfect deception. All have the precondition of an external hidden reality. For any false form to exist, there must be a reference form from which it was either imitating or distorting. There is no thing in itself that exists without reference, and no reference that exists without a thing in itself. Even the forgeries of dreams, illusions and hallucinations require the architecture of experience, the eye, memory of that which until then was a direct reference.
R is very limited for machine learning therefore any real machine learning projects are written in Python. Kotlin is never going to replace Java, it&#39;s syntax was made to be simpler than Java but Java has since made it&#39;s syntax simpler than Kotlin&#39;s and Kotlin cannot respond. While Java will only improve Kotlin can only get worse. Also, Instagram, discord and many other popular social media sites use Python. This year&#39;s developer survey shows that while Java is more used than Kotlin it is on the decline in terms of use. Meanwhile Python is only behind JavaScript.
I feel like I no nothing after seeing this üò≠
The video is ahh quite biGGG hehe :
well that escalated quickly
You should check out Plutus- It&#39;s like an evolved form of Haskell. Also used in Smart Contracts.
That C &quot;only supported procedural programming&quot; is not correct. You can do quite some magic with function pointers, and the basic fact that C++ in its first incarnations was implemented by translating C++ code into C code also directly disproves this. However, it was definitely unwieldy.
First thing I got when I started my apprenticeship for software Dev was a basics course cobol, afterwards you really appritiate java
You can actually &quot;program logic gates&quot; using either verilog or VHDL and synthesise your design onto an FPGA to create your own computer.
Verilog and VHDL ? Yeah it&#39;s not really programming language. But the programming blob is hungry ! We must feed it !
...So did anyone else hop straight in to C++ when they started learning to code?
and the first language im learning in college is C++ (i have completely no idea about programming)<br>wtf am i doing to myself, and wtf they doing to us bruh...
Can&#39;t code effectively but man do I know my logic gates, binary, circuits, and board components.
I expected this video to suck, but unexpectedly, it was one of the best video of its type, if not the best.
I see Viet Nam in here: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pEfrdAtAmqk&amp;t=947">15:47</a>
Now I&#39;m going to start my journey to become a legit programmer!!! Thanks!!!
I was taught LISP and Pascal in uni, fun times.
What about MATLAB?
Java, write once, debug everywhere...Made me laugh.
I was just gonna learn how to code next year, but now I&#39;m intimidated.
The lambda calculus is an example of something between &quot;Behind the Curtain&quot; @<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pEfrdAtAmqk&amp;t=882">14:42</a> and transistors. If you&#39;ve hacked on a language, even a toy one, you&#39;ve probably bumped up against models of computation like state machines, automata theory, regular grammars, and Œª-calculus. These are <i>conceptual</i> rather than actual languages; they&#39;re the mathematical bedrock of computation. Compilers draw heavily on this layer for both performance and correctness of higher level languages.<br><br>Think of compilers like a vertical slice of that iceberg that goes down to &quot;Behind the Curtain.&quot; Unless you write machine code, a compiler is making your life a lot easier. The layer of that iceberg supporting compilers is computability theory. Areas of math like abstract algebra start becoming <i>applied</i> math (e.g. lattices). This is where you get programs that write other programs, bridging the conceptual-to-implementable gap! It&#39;s also the level at which programs can formally verify, or prove, other programs. We can add Automath (1967), Coq (1989), and Idris (2007) as examples of that whole family of languages since they&#39;re still active.<br><br>Talk to your local compiler nerd if you find this interesting. You can identify them by the odd grin they make when you ask them about The Dragon Book.
ok so c++
I love that I&#39;m still in college and only truly know like two programming languages, but one of them is C++ because that&#39;s what my college chooses to teach. Had to wait nearly seven minutes for you to mention it. So I got that going for me at least... just don&#39;t ask me about java, js, html, css, actually just don&#39;t ask me about anything other than C++
my brain hurts
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pEfrdAtAmqk&amp;t=415">6:55</a> &quot;Soy-based languages&quot;? Was that an insult referring to soy milk (i.e. pussy languages)?

As someone who uses MATLAB almost exclusively I feel personally attacked by not even an honourable mention. I would say it sits just above python but below scratch and basic
me that startet with Cpp
you dont have to be on your death bed wondering if you should have learnt to code PHP the answer is a simple NO! HELL NO! NEVER! NEVER EVER EVER!<br>anything worth having coded in PHP already is.. and if its not then its not worth coding in PHP.all you need to know is how to deploy that shit and ideally how  to avoid it entierly to begin with by finding better alternatives to stuff like media wiki etc... i man yes you can get cheap php hosting. but that about the only benefit...
I programmed once withe assambly a compiler to programm machin code. I am an Electronics engineer. And i can only say this is the easyest Language existing. It just does exactly what i tell it to do. Its need a lot of time to write somthing. But you can know evrything from it. You dont move in a room created by others. You know evrything and you know where it belongs. There no problems exist where i think i dont know enought and sends me to searching in the internet.
I used to cling to C, but then Java, Scala and Ruby came about with features like JUnit and I could do TDD. I only pick up C when I want something running faster and can&#39;t really use bit by bit manipulation techniques to do it. There are so many things to play with outside of C like mixins, traits, mixed paradigms or open classes.
people often say the easiest path is the hardest and the hardest path is the easiest so I&#39;m glad this video differentiates itself from videos that just tell you what you need to learn to &quot;get rich quick&quot;

HI I aminto Trading stocks, I want to develop a statistical software. What Language do you suggest me to start up with to input data and process it for these matters?
I&#39;m over here hating my damn life that Youtube just turned this one as I&#39;ve been looking up C for STM32F7.<br>UGH
K, final stage is.. basically, you come to a point where you realize that you know nothing :)
C-- is mostly used as an intermediate representation for the Glasgow Haskell Compiler.
I thought you would talk about HDLs. What a missed opportunity.
GOD!!!My broo
This is perfect for procrastination. I should be learning about C# and Unity at the moment, but you all know why I am not.
what is the talking in the background
Speaking truth is ultimate help
started uni 5 weeks ago with c++, thinking about dropping out now.
Hey I&#39;m new to this programing community, everyone here seems quite experienced. I wanna land a high paying job so which of these languages should i start with and where?? Please help
you inspired me to start programing with transistors and binary
Python is beautiful, but I just can&#39;t get warm with dynamic languages somehow.<br><br>Clojure I have a problem with because of inconsistency.

This video was lit. Thank you so much for creating this. Educational and entertaining.
Me who has no knowledge about programming whatsoever, not understanding anything said in the video
As an engineer who has been working with software for the past 8 years now, here&#39;s my take on becoming employable for your coding ability:<br><br>1- At this point in time if your goal is to do software there is no reason to go any deeper than C/C++. That&#39;ll have you deal with most low level notions that could ever be relevant to you.<br>Don&#39;t overestimate the quality of coders out there. When I realized the jobs I wanted required coding skills, I spent two weeks binging on tutorials. As soon as I was able to know my way around setting up my programming environment and writing basic programs, I put it on my CV. Got hired within a few weeks and then learned from there. Companies are in such need to hire people that they will gladly hire someone who is inexperienced but who is showing real initiative, enthusiasm and competence in learning.<br><br>2- Instead of trying to learn a gazillion languages, I&#39;d say become really good at one. It&#39;s much better to be capable of doing complex tasks with one language than to be a jack of all trades who can perform super basic operations with a dozen languages.<br><br>Have one main programming language where you can do some complex tasks. Might be C/C++/C#, python, javascript. One of the big popular ones.<br>Then become minimally comfortable with how to use the command line and using batch scripts. This will allow you to tie different tools together and to learn how to control your environment a bit better. It will make you feel like a more &quot;complete&quot; developer.<br><br>3- Learn basic good practices:<br>use git! It&#39;s awful at first, it sucks, you&#39;ll be annoyed with it, but it&#39;s a must. People who code professionally do NOT exchange files by sending each other the latest update via e-mail or some group chat. They use repos so that there is traceability for changes and a commit history that allows you to see what changes were made recently with the ability to revert them if necessary.<br><br>Other good practice, learn to write unit tests. That might seem like a waste of time (it always feels that way) but it&#39;s actually going to save you much more time and inevitable bad surprises.<br><br>4- A caveat to #2, once you start being minimally comfortable with software development, you want to avoid becoming resistant to change and to learning new stuff. When a new project comes along, first see if it can be tackled properly with the tools you know. By properly I mean without the solution feeling like a complete hack. If it cannot, be open to learning a new library, or a new tool, a new method, or, in some cases, if necessary, a new language. But once you&#39;re comfortable with one language, it&#39;ll become increasingly easy to learn at least the basics of a new one. When you do something, before settling on an approach, always spend some time investigating if there exists a ready-made solution for what you&#39;re trying to do and try to do some research on whether there  exists a better architecture or code organization for doing what you need to do. Don&#39;t spend weeks on that, but allow yourself the time to look for a solution that might not have been the one you intuitively thought about. This is what will make you improve over time: you can do an awful lot with convoluted control flow schemes. But there&#39;s more to programming than that.<br><br>So that&#39;s my roadmap for you. To summarize:<br>- Focus on ONE popular language.<br>- Learn how to use the command line and batch scripts.<br>- Learn how to use git and use it systematically.<br>- Make unit tests a habit.<br>- Be open to learning new stuff when necessary (i.e. don`t reinvent the wheel. This isn`t 1972.)<br><br>To echo my final comment on point 4 -&gt; try to learn something new in every project. EVery time, there will be something you felt like you just wrapped it in duct tape because you had a deadline. Keep these bits in mind and in every new project, pick one of the things you felt could probably have done better in the previous project, and this time spend some time researching a better solution. Do this in every project and in 5 years, you&#39;ll start feeling like you&#39;re finally becoming a proper developer.
Im learning how to do C# it&#39;s crazy how programming is a big part in history slowly everything will be programmed from a computer and run by a complex script
1. Get a macbook
Excellent way to end the video by the way. Went to the bottom of the iceberg and then right past it down into the abyss. I think, therefore I am.
One of the first things I learned in programming classes was, essentially, computers are so complicated now that you can&#39;t design a modern computer without using computers. And when it&#39;s done, no one person really knows how the entire thing works in detail. You need many specialists.
I wish I knew enough about programming to understand the gravity that these things seem to have.
Why do i even exist?üò≠
I&#39;ve been making a great living in BASIC for over 30 years. I use it currently to run the back end for tons of high level web apps. <br>Sure, I know ASM, Pascal, C, Python, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, jQuery, SQL, Java but I prefer modern BASIC dialects.  <br>It&#39;s not the paintbrush, it&#39;s the artist.
I want a coding application that works like blender, but for writing programs. In blender you can write python code and see the result immediately in the 3D viewer. Also you can use nodes for a better visual way of keeping track of all the complexity. Or you can interact with the 3D model directly and it adjusts the code accordingly. However I don‚Äôt know if developers are capable of such a complex program. It would also be great if it was capable of voice commands.
Solipsism is a sin.
Holy C üòÇüòÇüòÇ
So basically c++ is better than Java.
PHP, Lua, and Swift are trash
ITS REALLY WORKED LOL THANK YOU DUDE
There is a point on the video that it gets real weird but i couldn&#39;t tell when...
Kabdjsjdj nice
This video is divine, thanks for taking your time on explaining stuff like this... LOL
Go is &quot;simpler&quot; then C?? How is fmt.Println( ) simpler than printf( )?  (notice I didn&#39;t have to capitalize the &#39;P&#39;). How is &quot;func plus( )&quot; simpler than &quot;plus( )&quot;?  And WHYY do modern language designers keep bringing back the totally unnecessary &quot;func&quot; or &quot;function&quot; prefix for functions. Their mere declaration is syntactically enough to infer they are functions. What they hell else would they be? (The concept of &quot;procedures vs. functions&quot; was buried long ago in the dark annals of early programming languages as something a difference nobody every really cared about except the language designer.)

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pEfrdAtAmqk&amp;t=288">4:48</a> i personally don&#39;t like type inference in statically typed languages because it almost gets rid of the point of a static type system.<br><br>int x = getsomevalue();<br><br>its perfectly clear what x is in this instance because its specified.<br><br>let x = getsomevalue();<br><br>it&#39;s not so clear, you would need to check the return type of getsomevalue just to know the type x is.<br><br>also a side note: don&#39;t hate on c and act like rust is so superior it hurts my feelings :(
I&#39;ll stop with rust. thx. will go the philosophy route once i graduate (in like 7 months)
This tutorial is amazing and you are really good at teaching !! great job sir !
Why cant everyone just use C , and stop all this confusing mess...
Thanks for fucking my mind !
Can anyone help me in farming here?
Interesting overview. You missed FORTH! ;-)

I started studying java as part of one of my first undergraduate CS courses. I have a tiny bit of experience in Python, but I must say... I really like java so far.
I&#39;ll say it: HTML is NOT a programming language. 6502 Machine Code or Bust.
SQL not used to write a complete program?!? spoke like someone who never wrote a complete program based PL/SQL triggers

Start with scheme
(old fart mode ON) assembly language is not scary or difficult at all. It describes doing things in very small and easy-to-understand steps.

so according to quantum mechanics, it is impossible to simultaneously learn and say learnt. <br>s(l, lt)= s(l)e^-(iElt/h)
Java is pretty much my no 1 favourite language because it has a crap ton of tools and stuff to work with and feels complete with many features. I learned OOP with Java.
It is much more like the history of programming language in 16minutes
Probably the best app from you..
ur a fcking legend dude honestly
C++ is ELITE
This was so helpful!! Thank you
You &quot;build&quot; Lego blocks... like you compose functions.  Which they certainly could be since function is extremely general.

Wtf man I was just starting to learn to code now I want to die
From 2005-2013 I worked in a big bank as a COBOL programmer. It was not so hard to understand as it was not object oriented. The newest version of COBOL we used was from 1986. Our biggest program was about 13&#39;000 lines of code but it was mostly (and this is how I would describe COBOL) just a lot of MOVE A TO B&#39;s.
Thanks Bruu

I loved the entire video. However the  ending was pure gold! XD
Cool Material:)
people that work on assembly code are saints and simultaneously bat shit insane
im currently learning C right now, it&#39;s definitely really interesting and the concept of pointers is cool
so when i started software engineering at my university , i had absolutely 0 knowledge or understanding of coding. we started with java and i personally found it to be really solid for grasping what programming is and how it works. It&#39;s a good ground where it&#39;s not extremely overly complex, but detailed enough to engage you in the more critical thinking part of software development at a beginner level
It&#39;s kinda scary if i think about the fact that i have used about a 1/3 of those over the course of my life including macroassembler and machinecode and some that are not even on the list because they are used in PLC, like a laddereditor
I started on COBOL yes I‚Äôm old. ü§£ Brilliant pr√©cis of languages! Thanks.
You missed Common Lisp, the best programming language in the world!<br>It&#39;s still DECADES ahead of almost all other programming languages, and still in active use!
I am learning c++ first...and let&#39;s just say that  without my background as a mathematician I would be completely screwed.
I understood about 55% of this video that‚Äôs a pretty bad sign isn‚Äôt it
JAVA WAS MADE BY A CANANDIEN
Love how you just go to a whole new level towards the end.
thank you very very very much, you help me a lot
I somehow feel professional and good now, because in my university i learned a lot of those languages. For me it&#39;s irrelevant which language i will use, as i can quickly learn it or have already mastered it. I would really love to program more in Assembler, though. That was very cool! :D
&quot;If that was too easy...&quot; X&#39;D

writing code is great. the iceberg is your brain. there is no right path. ignore everything i&#39;ve said.
gta 5 is written in lua too
that was both informative and hilarious.

Few points to note : <br><br>- Most modern dynamically typed languages <b>*ARE*</b> type-safe. They simply have a dynamic safety and not a static one. Which means, types are checked against operations at runtime. It is both a good and bad thing, depends on what you are looking for.<br><br>- Typescript doesn&#39;t adds a type system to Javascript, which already has a type system, it only extends it for simpler checking (MUCH simpler checking).<br><br>- In functional languages, &quot;variables&quot; are non existant, as everything is &quot;immutable values&quot; (a variable, by definition, is mutable, because it varies). This is one of the main points of functional languages, since it removes the risk of side effect and context dependency. On the other hand, it adds some patterns such as monads when you absolutely need to model something that is inherently imperative (e.g an actual *state*, memory of the past, as for example a user interface). It doesn&#39;t makes code worse tho, just a bit strange at first, and super elegant once you get the idea behind it :)<br><br>- This video is definitely super fun to watch and quite accurate TBH, I laughed way too hard for the jokes about pointers, and likely will reuse the joke when teaching about pointer !

I love the descent into esoteric self-exploration. Will now switch my major to philosophy.
I&#39;ve just started to fuck around with HTML and CSS. I think it was a bad idea to watch this video cause now I&#39;m extremely depressed üòÇ
I think my brain is slowing blowing up with all these languages. It doesn‚Äôt help that one language is similar to another language  however uses specific keywords and blocks to make a program.
Every single programmer I&#39;ve worked alongside in my 10 years in the field has either fucked off to management or some form of ops/admin work. lol.
Great video!, you did not mention hardware languages like VHDL.üòÖ
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pEfrdAtAmqk&amp;t=360">6:00</a> and now my brain is on fire
I&#39;m applying as a dishwasher.
c++ is not that harder man don&#39;t scare them but I wouldn&#39;t recommend it
including holy c is fucking based as the youths would say
I&#39;m happy I watched this. Total brainf***k. It&#39;s fun.
I don&#39;t see Objective-C on this list. I was recently forced to use it at work and now I know what hate really feels like.
Surely something is Turing complete or not, it‚Äôs not subjective. Saying that, I know nothing of coding.
100 sec videos about those new low level languages like zig, nim, odin would be nice
Great video and very useful. Hope you could monetize it!
Oomygod. I quit

No one operates as if reality is just in your own mind, save psychopaths and severely mentally ill schizophrenic. If anyone thinks that dead end incoherent illogical argument for knowledge is the end all, they need to think more, read more and dive deeper into logic, it&#39;s a mistake.
I am living in the simulation.
Where does it put me if I started with Assembly and thought it was cool so I switched my uni degree to computer science?

Don&#39;t forget Whitespace, the programming language that entierly consists of tabs and spaces.
This man really went from Basic to George Berkley
thank you so much dude you&#39;re a god
That was great. Thank you.
Anyone cringe when people call SQL sequel
My first year of college, with no requirement for previous programming skills, we learned Java... And Assembly üíÄ Java was alright, it&#39;s not too difficult once you get how it works. But Assembly? No. Just no.
I saw you skip that JSFuck logo.
Even if you&#39;re not planning on using haskell (and I&#39;m definitely not), conceptualizing pure functions and using them appropriately is still a requirement to be a great software developer. <br>IMO, of course. Because a statement from a random on the internet like me is always the absolute truth.
Mindblowing.
I absolutely love how this ended.
good
Where the fuck is ABAP :(
This was so helpful!! Thank you
The other geniuses can code I‚Äôll move to farming
U BEST!!!
seeing high schoolers a year behind me learn Scratch killed me inside<br>especially since my first was Java, and it wasnt that hard
Tysm bro, i got a job as an Electrician üíÄ
Xcode should be bottom of the iceberg while assembly fell off years ago and is currently sitting on the ocean floor.
You mentioned Elixir and Erlang individually but didn&#39;t mention that Elixir runs on the Erlang VM and can run Erlang code fluently.
scratch, python, java, c, prolog, assembly, psychedelic experiences and philosophical question about what knowledge and life actually is.<br><br>thank you, i guess I really understand programming already
first moment I saw the map in the video I started looking for Clojure and Erlang ü§£
Java :( Need i say more?
Man, are you okay?
python - java - html - css
Soooo I should not start with machine code? <br>Oh geez.
For the beginners I would like to recommend &quot;Trying any easy language first&quot;. Just find if you like doing it and think if you want to find yourself doing the same thing in the long run.  I know software developer is a very very popular job nowadays. It also mean the competition is going to be huge. You will need to work harder to earn a place as a software developer. <br>For me , I quitted and change my career after forcing myself to love the web development.

what about wetware programming
worked for me on huawei thank you so much!
worked for me on my motorolla
I know x86 (and some x64) assembly, C, C++, C# and Solidity. Solidity is definitely the most odd language of the bunch, because the EVM (Ethereum Virtual Machine) has a different way of running than physical hardware and it&#39;s difficult to begin understanding how code executes in it and how state works.<br><br>I also know a fair bit of Java and I can read Javascript and Python but don&#39;t like any of them. I loath Haskell and I&#39;m <i>not</i> a fan of functional programming or the elitist attitudes that some people develop when they get out of their minds for functional programming. I work as a software engineer in the <i>game industry</i> and we really value the OOP paradigm for the way it creates structure and order and for the blazing fast performance of languages like C++ and C#. It&#39;s the right tool for the job, and functional programming just isn&#39;t ... if I was working at a science research lab or something then I&#39;d feel differently, but I&#39;m doing what I always wanted to do and engineering game engines and games. OOP has one hell of a second learning curve <i>after</i> you learn the language: learning about software architecture, design patterns, clean code principles (e.g., SOLID, DRY, etc) and it&#39;s not an easy tool to learn to wield. But once you&#39;ve really learned it and gained experience, learned not to write spaghetti code and understand the &quot;philosophy&quot; of OOP, it&#39;s amazing to work with.<br><br>My absolute favorite language is definitely C# ... it&#39;s super elegant, modern and clean, it&#39;s super fast (both in terms of execution speed and development speed), has the absolute best debugging and IDE experiences of <i>any</i> language out there, it&#39;s scalable and maintainable, and it&#39;s extremely powerful. I pretty much always prefer doing things in C# unless there&#39;s compelling reasons <i>not</i> to, which there rarely are ... nowadays, C# runs on every important hardware/OS platform and does everything from game development to web apps. You can even create web apps with no ugly Javascript, which almost makes me want to do a bit of web dev, haha.
The end piece about &quot;reality&quot; made me subscribe. This was some highly informative and excellent content. <br><br>Always wanted to try a deep level langauge and Nim became my option, all thanks to the hard work you put in for the development of this here gem.

you forgot the delphi tier after the &quot;yourself&quot; one
Thank you for sharing this tutorial
My first introduction to coding was through Minecraft redstone back in the day
Imagine pulling up to an interview and you whip out emojicode or chef
After 40 years of programming I wish I jumped on the C bandwagon when it came out. At that time I was on ANSI and Turbo Pascal, and was happy. Today I am on C for anything serious, and happy. <br>  Having C under your belt, makes it a breeze to adapt to any other language that comes up over time, even OO languages ( that do everything the other way around ).
This is great, thank you!
The end is so funny
Misleading.

aw rip so terry was only 2 tiers from true enlightenment
lol when i was a kid in the 90s i first used basic and fell in love with programming. scratch didn&#39;t exist but u need this level 1 language to get ppl interested fo sho

cool video but you forgot the manufacturing languages for industrial machines like siemens plc`s to control the machine. i am learning that and it seems easy until you want to do very precise stuff. then you go down a rabbit hole where you indeed want to blow your brains out.
Were going through hell
In the first and second year of computer science we were taught java, haskell, prolog and assembler language. What a fun ride.
F, sharp! üòÆ
No mention of verilog, vhdl? Close at end but no name drop.

You missed the most popular (by a long shot) functional programming language: Excel.
Me and my logic gate for my modular synthesizer is hanging out at the bottom of the berg!
I think therefore I am, and if we can agree that we all think therefore we are, than we can talk, and begin to understand the world around us together. It is because of other consciousness that we know we are real at all.
ice its actually working, im suprised
The ironic thing in all your iceberg is that rather old languages like Common Lisp (1984), Haskell (1991/, Erlang(1986), and in some ways Smalltalk (1972) and Ocaml (1989?), are still the most advanced production-ready programming languages today.
So i am fucking crazy by starting with C++ then? ;^; <br>Because it felt like i was.. (i mean i learned  and understood it quickly, buuuut you know)
I&#39;m now a jack of all trades, but unable to do anything in any of them
I started my career as a nuclear engineer in 2009 working with reactor physics and fuel performance codes written in FORTRAN. I didn&#39;t have an IDE either, just notepad and the compiler. My colleague remembered a time when he had to walk to the computer building with his deck of cards and return the next day for the results - good times!
Cobol it is then.
I&#39;m waiting on the language to end all languages to start learning programming. <br><br>A language as intuitive as how a person speaks their native language. One that uses direct conversational human language. Direct commands like following an instructional manual, or recipe. <br><br>I used to think object oriented programming would be fun because I imagined it would be just like dragging and dropping literal objects like a folder üìÇ  or file that represents specific instructions and connecting it together. Kinda like building a website with Squarespace or something lol<br><br>Hopefully one day we get there.

That said, even if it was actually written &quot;Malebolgia&quot;, the i wouldnt be pronounced, as it&#39;s there just to  change the sound of the otherwise hard g (unless the stress of the word is on that letter, but this is not the case).<br><br>Basically, the Malebolge is a place which includes 10 bolge (this one, instead, makes plural as bolge and singular as bolgia) with as many different kinds of sinners

Rocks were never meant to think, once again humanity has proven its sadistic nature

Knowing what knowledge is, is actually pretty easy...<br><br>1) What is illuminated by awareness (you don&#39;t even have to define what a fundamental &quot;thing&quot; looks like, it&#39;s an element of the set representing awareness; the origin of this process, aka why is there a separation of me vs every-thing else will always be uncertain IMO)<br>2) Since knowledge implies a subject to learn said knowledge, this is generalized as a subject vs object relationship.; thus there is a notion of a self to reinforce the subject vs object duality. The simplistic notion of what the self is, is that which is able to distinguish things from itself (whatever definition of itself it may believe/think in reference to; through meditation one can see one is still present in the absence of the mind, I&#39;m trying to not go too deeply into non-duality though)<br><br>Knowledge is that which we recognize to be apart from ourselves. The act of recognition is an activity from that which we deem &quot;the mind&quot; (there&#39;s some sort of acknowledgement, either by physical means through reaching out to grasp it OR a mental projection of some-thing in our mind&#39;s eye). Since we are not the mind on account of being aware of it, that also indicates that any-thing the mind perceives must also be some-thing in the field of awareness (can we be aware of the unaware?). Thus knowledge can be represented as the set of experiences (sustained through memory), more specifically the collection of &quot;things&quot; we perceived to not be of ourselves. You can then further divide this knowledge (set operations of sorts; this part I&#39;m iffy on, exploring fuzzy sets atm to see if knowledge can be mathematically represented as this) into subsets, developing a &quot;more precise&quot; idea of how a field of knowledge can be characterized as. Experientially, this is represented as first hearing about a subject, being curious about it or learning through accident more details about the subject, then gradually developing a more nuanced view on the subject itself (while the notion of what that subject is gradually expands/has more elements over time). Simplified further, knowledge is that which we think we know, the act of knowing is something we ourselves define (aka pattern recognition since pattern recognition implies a subject to recognize said patterns, the mental consequence of classification).

Wow, never thought I&#39;d see Hack on a list of programming languages.  Pretty sure that&#39;s only used internally at Meta/FB.<br><br>Also isn&#39;t objective C based on Smalltalk?  In fact, you probably should mention Objective C since it&#39;s still used a lot alongside Swift.  In tech, there has been a lot of bouncing back and forth with switching to swift, then switching back to not using swift, and some still don&#39;t use Swift at all. (Ahem, meta/fb again)

Worked, thx
The funniest thing for me in this video was remembering learning Pascal in school and C -&gt; C++ in university. No simple HTML, python or at least java, we were burrowed in high-level shit and told it was the best way to learn
&quot;... and if I were to say HTML is not a programming language I would be immediately cancelled by the tech community&quot; say what?? HTML isn&#39;t a programming language, it&#39;s a markup language. I would think you&#39;d get cancelled for saying it&#39;s a real language instead. Although with templating languages these days I&#39;d almost consider JS, HTML and CSS as a single package.
basic puns.. nice.
I found sad that you never mencioned Matlab :(
Just started my cs degree, and first language what we are learning is java‚Ä¶ never felt so stupid in my life
forgot VBA, the most popular language in all of programming
That is awesome man, thank&#39;s for that, i appreciate this!
I really don&#39;t get the love for C#. The language has way too many entirely redundant features, MS sucks, and .NET is a mess with incredibly poorly organized documentation. Is it just Windows devs with Stockholm syndrome?
Installed, everything works, thanks!
now i am in a good mood
In 2009 I was a freshman at an admittedly sub-tier state university. I thought I was interested in Computer Science, until the first day of an intro class where we had to buy the book the professor wrote, told half of us would fail, and we&#39;d be learning to code in Ada.
Qiskit?
Very nice! I like the ending!! Great video!!
start with the fundamentales, then learn the tools to solve a problem, that defines your language that you&#39;ll use...it&#39;s not about the language, it&#39;s about the issues You need to solve..
I think my uni might have the crazyest of plans, because in firts year you learn Python, then never touch it again, and then they teach you computational methods in Fortran. I did my final thesis last year in Fortran. It is very much still in use xD<br><br>I use python at work know but I miss the matrices so much, they are so much better for math code.
APL is actually &quot;a programing language&quot;???? that is amazing xDD

Are you good my man?
got me at &quot;always bet on JS, you&#39;&#39;ll never lose&quot;
that&#39;s why I hate and love coding, I realized this s..t too late. Now I totally don&#39;t give a fu..k about new languages. This is the result of years chasing the infinity, the languages I learnt, in order:<br><br>C, C++, Matlab,  Java, Basic, Pascal, Visual Basic, C# , JavaSCript, HTML (not a language in my mind, but still), CSS, XML, Python, Ruby on Rails, R...<br><br>Learning all this sh..t and related frameworks libraries fuc..ed up soo much of my time, because this is never ending especially if you need to find a job. Every year a new shi.t pops out.<br><br>So i manged to leave the rat race, I&#39;m working for my self, I still code but I consider coding a tool, nothing so esoteric, because in the end it&#39;s always the same stuff wrapped up over and over again to give you some little incremental functionalities. So these are probably the &quot;tools&quot; I will use until I die:<br><br>**Languages:<br>C++, Java, c#, Js (Typescript), Python, Powershell, Bash   <br><br>**Major Frameworks/libraries<br>Angular, Blazor, Pandas, SCi kit learn, numpy, plotly, Api Frameworks (Django, MS WebApi), Jquery<br><br>**Cloud<br>Azure, Az Function, Az AppSErvice, Devops, Kubernetes (the only cool thing that came out of all this shi.t), servicebus, eventhub, databrick, pyspark<br><br>**Theory<br>Learn, read and practice (yes, read (no videos) and practice) design patterns, just keep your code clean, this is the most important thing.<br><br>That&#39;s it, no more than this is required to rule the coding world.<br><br>I managed to get out of the rat race by investing the first time in Self Storage, not very cool but it made money. <br>I&#39;ve invested in real estate, trade/invest, have some small business.<br><br>Hopefully on the future, there will be a small bunch of languages that will be universally used. I hope for future devs that JS will not be so prominent.

This is the best free software Ive seen. Respect.
I hate how in my uni we started with pascal then moved to C then to assembly, and by the time I got my degree pascal had been replaced with C and C++ was included. So I ended up hating programming due to fucking pascal, which I never really learned to use and barely passed the class.
For once, the software is actually really useful

Fun fact: Holy C actually runs even faster than C is even more versatile, with the caveat being that it only runs on TempleOS, which has no concept of privilege or protection, so *every program runs at ring 0*.
INTERCAL&#39;s &#39;please&#39; keyword actually kind of does something. If you don&#39;t use the keyword often enough, your code refuses to compile because you&#39;re too rude. If you overuse the keyword, the code refuses to compile because you&#39;re trying too hard to please.

&lt;] respect your work mate. TA Is all well and good but I find it truly baffling that all major crypto youtubers just look at pure TA and completely Ignore the bigger narrative of why BTC is fluctuating and why the future outlook is more encouraging as it seems. It&#39;s kinda Irresponsible to ignore the fact that each ETF launch so far has caused a major dump at the peaks of BTC.. we were already on shaky footing with historically low volume and almost pure whale pumps, narrowly avoiding a long-term bear market. This Is the worst possible time in history to invest as so many don&#39;t back up their crypto assets... more emphasis should be put into day trading as it is less affected by the unpredictable nature of the market. I have made over 7 btc from day trading with Justina Lumen, insights and signals in less than 3 weeks, this is one of the best medium to backup your assets incase it goes bearish. I left Justina contact below take care!...reach her VIA TE LE GRAM &lt;Justinalumen
the mandelbrot reference made me chuckle
Thank you for explaining this thoroughly!
I feel like one missed class of languages are HDL:s, sure computers chips are built from logic gates, but no one designs big digital circuits on a gate or transistor level nowadays. Hardware description languages like Verilog or VDHL are used to simply the process and increase the abstraction level.
amazing video, i was looking at the site and didn&#39;t noticed this get license button üòÖ

My favorite part of this video is,  it only remained to the language explanation and couldn&#39;t even start talking about actual SWDevelopement stuff ;)
Seriously, if you‚Äôre working solo and want to write a java application you are way better off writing kotlin and targeting the jvm
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pEfrdAtAmqk&amp;t=829">13:49</a> I think emoji code is actually a cool idea. Emojis can convey their meaning faster than text, so if we could translate code into an emoji representation, it could improve productivity and readability/orientation.

After learning all these codes, you are saying that external environments all are fake...
im at the +<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pEfrdAtAmqk&amp;t=36">00:36</a> second mark and can tell you now: everything is just an abstraction of pointers that you will wrangle with c. And if you need more, now you&#39;re just messing with assembly instructions, fin.
The real shit starts at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pEfrdAtAmqk&amp;t=965">16:05</a>
Java is an absolute dumpster fire regardless of skill level.  Period.  It lacks the ability to do templated inheritance and every single operation throws exceptions, which, if uncaught, will crash the application.  The only thing you can do to keep your Java applications from crashing is to wrap the entire app in a giant try-catch and ignore every single exception.  I gave up years ago trying to fix all of the crash bugs in my Android apps written in Java, wrapped them up in try-catch to ignore every single exception, and called it a day.  Everything&#39;s been free of crash bugs ever since.
I d–æwnloaded everything is okay
I feel like walking into a cave in the middle of nowhere and calling it a day. I can grow a beard and whittle something. Thank you.
Psychedelics have never tried to mimic sobriety at me. Is that unusual?

Theres so many of them that only use walls.. they think if they still get the kill themselves its not really cheating, their just giving themselves the edge is all..
i personally am i chad and i know assembly 86 c# and python like a man of culture

I used to code the wildest things with actionscript, now I have to centre divs. FML :) Farm for me too LOL
You seem to forget VHDL, Verilog and ASIC.
I&#39;m not trying to flex, just to add a little clarity for those really interested. I do RE so I work in ASM 5 days a week. <br><br>Below ASM is not straight to binary. You could learn the OPCODES generated by ASM instructions/mnemonics. Instructions add a layer of abstraction to the differences in the minutia of src and dst type (reg, mem, imm) and size of the operands. One ASM instruction might have a dozen opcode variants. This is actually quite useful for some things; most obviously modifying/hacking binaries or constructing &#39;shellcode&#39;. Also, learning binary is quite useless, so lets skip to something useful at the next level.<br><br>Bare-metal programming is another step below doing assembly on top of an OS. Bare metal is writting the entire program in assembly to interface the hardware directly. THis is done easily with microcontrollers.<br><br> TTL,Transitor-Transistor Logic, is (in my opinion) using ICs that are mostly Logic-based (OR, NAND, XOR, etc) to create programs. Using 74LSXXX chips are a great way to pull a layer of abstraction away from a uCPU&#39;s mariyid logic gates. There are many projects where people build entire computers using TTL 74LSXXX chips to created the ALU, Instruction Decoder/Encoder, etc.<br><br>There are several other layers i think that would come before microchip fabrication and quantum mathmatics.
Me in the end : whatta f*ck, you going too deep
I d–æwnloaded everything is okay

All these languages and they made us learn ADA in school...
You skipped Perl?  The duct tape that held the internet together ca 2000?
Well, I will just develop my project in C#. Because it&#39;s the best language and I know it most.
&quot;PLEASE&quot; in INTERCAL actually does have a use. If you don&#39;t use please often enough, the compiler will not execute, producing an error regarding politeness. It&#39;s not a valuable use, but it is required for the language to operate.
that escalated quickly, lol
LMAO how are the meme languages even mentioned? These are not codes at all, it‚Äôs just garbage
When he got to c++<br>me: LET&#39;S FUCKING GOOOOO LADS!
;Pretty comprehensive but you skipped two languages which has logos in them: &quot;Modern Language that you haven&#39;t heard of&quot; and &quot;Historically Important Language&quot;.  Raku (aka Perl 6) and Perl 4/5.<br><br>There are two that you might want to include: Verilog and VHDL.

Amazingly you have forgotten the programming language RPG by IBM. It was created in 1959. It is still in use today at companies still having mainframes in production.
I think I am already at the last stage. Or maybe I should stop watching Anime.
Well my wicked professor started üôÑ üòí us with C instead of python or Javascript  for beginners like I&#39;ve never coded in my life and he started us with C like when i come to class I&#39;m always confused i watch youtube videos but bro i just feel stupid  i remember before i started uni i was learning python and i thought wow programming is easy until i saw C and i wanna just live on a farmüò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠

HTML + CSS is turing complete? oh my god..
Before you reached transistor level you had to mention VHDL and Verilog.
BROOO thankyou so much, this really helped and the tutorial was really easy to use as well :)
My programming journey was: Basic (C64 in the early 80s) -&gt; Pascal (PC) -&gt; Assembly (M68000) -&gt; C (PC) -&gt; C++ (PC) -&gt; Simula (at Uni) -&gt; Assembly (x86)....after that...I have not really programmed much for the past 30 years.

So you&#39;re telling me that as an electronics engineering student I am learning(in a &quot;fundamentals&quot; class) about logic gates, and the only thing harder than that is quantum electrodynamics. Awesome. No wonder why i hate my life. I came here to see if I want to switch to software development and this definitely helps. But then I&#39;m sure I&#39;ll want to die then too just with less ones and zeros and things that look like dicks.

The thing about C# is that it started as an O-O language but is quickly evolving into a functional language. It&#39;s a thing of beauty.

i learned c++ and c# without any of the other coding knowledge
And then each of these programming languages have from hundreds to thousands of frameworks to abstracts your code from the complexities of different APIs, standard algorithms, operating systems, and platform features. And then, there are build systems‚Ä¶
ahhh out of all the videos this worked thanku

At <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pEfrdAtAmqk&amp;t=73">1:13</a>, when the speaker says &quot;you might be surprised what you can build with it,&quot; was the Scratch game that appeared supposed to show off how impressive Scratch projects can get? Because... that game literally looked and sounded like a fake game they animate for a sitcom or advertisement. Scratch&#39;s website has a dedicated Featured selection, I could find a sample of something more amazing in 30 seconds.

Yeah C is easy to learn until you&#39;re trying to pass an array to a function and you have to pass a pointer to a pointer that you have to alter the value of to traverse the array. I get what you mean though, its relatively easy as far as low level programming goes.
No mention of Eiffel?

So as a Julia lover... It allows you to be either static or dynamic typed. Proper Julia code declares types for everything and if a type is declared the compiler enforces it strictly. It&#39;s the big advantage Julia has over Python/R

You don&#39;t learn &quot;a language&quot;. That&#39;s such a &quot;your uncle on Christmas dinner&quot; approach to programming.<br><br>You learn software development. I learned Java, C, C++, C# and PHP in University. Does that mean I can&#39;t program in Python? Lol of course I can. It&#39;s structured but admits objects, and has weak typing (kind of like PHP, with many things from the other languages). I can&#39;t really do functional programming, and I&#39;m not very strong on declarative programming, of course, for that I&#39;d need an extra. <br><br>But for 90% of the jobs out there, when it&#39;s not the languages I&#39;m an expert on, I&#39;m just 1 month of work away from being a senior programmer on them as well.

I‚Äôve never understood the logic behind people sharing ‚Äúthe best programming language right now‚Äù. People are forgetting that learning language is just that, learning a language. What one needs to learn is the basics of computer programming. Its not how you write, rather what your write.
The real question is what language is the simulation we are in is written in, hope it&#39;s not Java.
The end is epic

i love that he talks like hes serious but hes not
so i will learn assembler now
I learned BASIC first but Pascal after that. No mention of the legendary Pascal? After that I picked up a real language C++ and mixed assembler because you couldn&#39;t do graphics in C++ without ASM code at that time.
PHP is still used quite a bit at Facebook. To say they used to use it or whatnot, is not the truth. I know enough engineers at Facebook to definitively say, it&#39;s still a lot of goddamn PHP. Which isn&#39;t bad, as PHP is pretty good now. After Facebook did the HipHop program to optimize it, that was built in to V7 of PHP and now it&#39;s pretty damn efficient.

Wait.
I&#39;ve been programming proffessionally in Silicon Valley for the last 5 years, &amp; I can say this checks out. Most everything I do has been in Python and Javascript (+HTML/CSS), and sometimes Java. After running into the limitations of OOP/dynamic types, I started exploring functional languages &amp; approaches and other statically typed languages. One note is that my undergraduate studies actually had us explore this iceberg in a u-shape: top, lower, then back to top again.
As a non-programer, C++ is by far the most talked about and used in schools around me. Didn&#39;t even know the name of any other ones here.

I just want to make good money making websites
Keep trying
Nice list, but I missed microcode (the programming language used for telling the CPU how to execute the machine code)
Forth, postscript, clone, ladder... So many more. I learnt about a few more here, thanks.
can really relate to the trip thing man
May I please post another comment? I am amused at how you ended your descent with the philosophical question of knowledge and epistemology. Ha ha ha ha! You don&#39;t have to go that deep, dude. You are making this more difficult than is needed. Instead, you might have mentioned the <b>analog</b> computer.
Also, I had an absolute blast learning assembly language. In fact, if assembly language does not interest you, then you are not a true programmer!
SQL is not a true programming language. You can&#39;t even produce a &quot;Hello World&quot; program, for instance (actually, I guess that you sort of could). You could not do a mandelbrot set, though. It should be thought of an interface to databases.
I know how to program in assembler, design digital circuits with gates and a little bit of C, but I can&#39;t understand the rest
ABAP. Where is ABAP.<br><br>You should have included a psychosis warning. Almost not audible children sounds in the background are no joke to a morbus studiosus! :D
Tcl?
What about the programming language used in the human brain?
I kind of like the fact that Mupms didn&#39;t make it into the video, hence it is not a programming language.
Everything works perfectly
Wow. This was so comprehensive. And the end was unexpected. Good job man.

I&#39;m weird in the sense I kinda went all over the place. I started in C#, got really used to that then got really into PowerPC/x86 assembly then tried web development and I&#39;ve been in a programming crisis ever since. C#/Assembly just makes sense to me for some reason but when I tried to make something in react or make a website period I just wanna throw my keyboard. I do not like web development lol

I was wondering how far down all the electrical engineer shenanigans would be on this list. Assembly isn‚Äôt that hard unless you don‚Äôt have the hundreds of pages documentation of what your working with.

Interesting... I thought C was designed by Dennis Ritchie. That stuck with me because the first C compiler I got was some K&amp;R C clone (or so I was told)... so at best Brian Kernighan (the K in K&amp;R) and Richie made C. Not even Wikipedia mentions Ken Thompson for C. But Thompson made B and Unix which is not less an accomplishment.
I&#39;ve programmed in HTML, Java and Python. I had to learn HTML and Java for classes (in college and high school respectively), but Python I have only learned as a hobby. I also used a markup language called Harlowe, which is only used in a obscure software called Twine that is made for making branching interactive stories that are playable in a web browser, but I&#39;ve always ended up calling HTML when using Harlowe so what I wrote in Twine was kind of a hybrid between the two. This is an interesting watch, it&#39;s interesting to see how programming languages develop.
who else went to see mandelbrot set in scratch
I see there&#39;s no love for Live Code
Good work
At the very bottom you have thinkscript
I learnt assembly, so it&#39;s mean, I learnt from the top to the bottom of the iceberg?
You&#39;re me aren&#39;t you? I&#39;m getting surer and surer that this is all in my/our head!
Alright, so we&#39;ve went from Scratch to discovering the ultimate question of whether we really exist and if our minds can be broken down into nothing but ones and zeros... makes sense.

Have been up and down almost every level (except the very tippy top). Most of these languages have been at least OK, some have been pretty great experiences. But Lisp... let&#39;s just say Lisp and I aren&#39;t on speaking terms.
And what are the options to program genomes with crispr? When you put &quot;you&quot; a the end I was sure you will talk about one or more of this new langages that compile to &#39;crispr commands&#39;. i don&#39;t know how to even name it.
....what....the....FUCK
I&#39;d say that the esoteric languages rank lower than things like assembly or machine code. In that, you never actually encounter them, they exist purely as a joke between programmers and/or to test your skill in learning new languages and concepts.<br><br>machine code and assembly actually have a functional use - you can get paid to know low level languages. you cannot get paid to know brainfuck (or my preferred version, fuckfuck)<br><br>I also like whitespace as a esoteric language. completely fucking unusable. its great. Also you can encode whitespace into other code, and then depending on the interpreter you use run the whitespace code or the real program. is fun
With regards to the intro<br><br>The actual #1 programming language right now to learn is Cobol. what you do in Cobol doesn&#39;t translate well to other programming languages, but also other language concepts don&#39;t translate well to Cobol, this makes it difficult to use and also, its incredibly outdated, having been invented in 1959. It is niche but many companies still run on systems that can&#39;t be upgraded by people who do not understand Cobol.<br><br>Cobol has no future, the only current use of knowing cobol is upgrading systems away from cobol.<br><br>there, enjoy your riches.<br>i hate cobol.<br><br>Edit: Finished the video, saw what he said about Cobol. Yes.
I feel like batch is both at the tip of the iceberg and at the deepest, darkest point.

Man, things are so different these days, although you have certainly hit upon a few of the key points I&#39;ve watched over the years.  I discovered BASIC in a geometry textbook appendix when I was in tenth grade. I whined until I got a VIC-20 and learned BASIC and 6502 ML. That was more than enough for my first programming job in the &#39;80s.<br><br>But the next step was going to have to be either Pascal or C, both of which were supported by those amazing new IDEs Borland introduced. I physically went to a physical bookstore and purchased Turbo C. I made a living in the corporate world with C for about eight years, adding SQL and shell scripting along the way.<br><br>Then came Visual Basic for a few years I&#39;d rather not think too hard about, then Java. That one lasted me a very long time. It was introduced to me by an IBM consultant who was excited about their new &quot;Visual Age&quot; IDE. Youngsters will know it as Eclipse. I knew it as a properly object oriented language with a never ending series of new libraries and techniques.  EJB 1.0 anyone? None for me, thanks, my brain is full. I admit it: It took me too long to absorb functional programming because it became so easy to do so much with OOP, and I had to support pre-8 Java versions for a long time anyway.<br><br>These days I use JavaScript a lot, which is probably why I&#39;m awake right now typing comments on Youtube at 4 AM. I work with a team that really only knows JS frameworks, so I adapt. But man, the lack of native type safety feels so weird.<br><br>The next big thing for programmers should probably be Rust. I&#39;m learning it myself because if my portfolio collapses I&#39;ll be working for a few more decades. Besides, for a real developer, the learning is the real reward.
I got to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pEfrdAtAmqk&amp;t=540">9:00</a> and hugged my Eloquent Javascript book so tight that I broke the binding

A very nice and informative video.<br><br>As for ADA, if I may, it&#39;s main selling point is that it&#39;s safe.<br>As in, when coded, you can prove that your program won&#39;t crash.<br>Well, it may not do what you wanted it to do, but that would be because YOU the programmer, made a mistake, not the compiler.<br>Also, it came with network and multitasking out of the box, that&#39;s really sweet.<br>The only problem I can see is that it&#39;s really, really verbose for the declarative part.<br>You can&#39;t just programm &quot;on the fly&quot; and see what will stick.<br>You need to declare everything and anything.<br><br>So, ADA?<br>Hell yes! but for big, security focused programs.

MY GMS DOES NOT soft LIKE YOURS
eww.. not basic.  Qbasic.  Qbasic is for beginners.  Basic is just a bad language all around.<br>JS and PY are not a step 2 language...  JS is basically web C... PY is basically bloat-trash.<br>HTML and CS should be before JS... you won&#39;t even be using JS programmatically until you know HTML...<br>C# is just user friendly C++... extra garbage collection and error handling built in...<br>Which to your point about garbage collection for GO, no.  You still have to worry about memory management.  Not doing so is why you encounter so many programs that have memory leaks.  Always.  This is the case always.<br>I wouldn&#39;t call C, C++ low level... when I learned them they were not considered such.  Low level is asm like MASM and TASM.  <br>No one really writes in machine code, machine code is what MASM and TASM create.<br>You then use that machine code to compile an EXE or COM file...<br>And this is an illusion, but centering it around yourself because you are bound to your own knowledge is a flawed approach and lacks awareness.<br>Programming since 1995... when I was 12.

In the game engine Unity, C# (C-Sharp) is to C++ what C++ is to C.<br><br>The key part of any program language that makes it easier or not to learn is how easy is it to see results and debug failures. For example, Unity, as a game engine, gives you an immediate preview of what you wrote and give you a direct approach toward seeing where the problem is. That&#39;s, by its nature, covering over 90% of the job (and the most ugly part) from using language that doesn&#39;t offers such &quot;ease of use&quot;.

In transistors cases, you can design algrebraic bool, later subs with logic gates (2 or more transistors) wich is more easier, this is a principle for ALU in CPUs.
ITS REALLY WORKED LOL THANK YOU DUDE
CPU transistor does not store 1 bit, you need a flip-flop or a latch to store it, and those needs multiple transistors. A DRAM transistor can store 1 bit, but needs a constant refresh.

Where is Perl to be honest
This truly helped me thnxÔôè
this was actually quite funny, maybe im just desperate humourize the least fun part of my life
I‚Äôve been experinting and posting I tNice tutorialnk I‚Äôve gotten pretty ok for my first year
bro you missed dna and genetic code
It&#39;s not an iceberg, silly!<br><br>It&#39;s a rabbit-hole...<br><br>To a labyrinth...<br><br>With no exit.
No love for PLEX? Erlang gets all the thunder I guess....
Stop saying that Python syntax is simple. It absolutely fascistically requires absolutely fascistically relentless rigour of indentation. NOT simple. Also your example of &quot;pretty ugly&quot; JS syntax was ridiculously artificial and contrived.
Probably the best video I ever watched in my life
thank you for work keys and crack
A little dissapointed that UwU++ wasnt included
my app soft in gms doesn&#39;t soft like that it is different.please help
You know nothing John Snow...
how do u make money  from creating a coding language ?
The bottom of the iceberg is making computers in minecraft.
Full iceberg developer
Bro your /g/ is showing
Can&#39;t even find &#39;Perl&#39; in the comments (at least superficially)<br>Poor Perl guys.
thanks ,,,, the finishing was awesome ma sha ALLAH
lmao i coded in dr.racket. Waste of time
XD
It&#39;s really funny when you are working on the deepest level. Designing transistors on silicon
But guys R is also a functional language :D
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pEfrdAtAmqk&amp;t=35">0:35</a> you had no right to do that to me. I felt my mind turning to mush as I repeated the segment for the 10th time.
Very informative video, you were the tipping point that made me choose welding. Thank you!
I don&#39;t know to code, but I have a Master&#39;s in philosophy. I watched this Youtiube video because... well, algorithm. You&#39;re the developer, you tell me.<br>But imagine my joy when I found out I can program in the highest programming language there is, Epistomology! Now, finally, I too can apply to a job where I earn money instead of pitiful looks!
You don&#39;t even know if you know nothing, by the way.
Man for real
Making mental lists of the languages I <b>definitely</b> and <b>for sure</b> will learn... <b>for sure this time</b> <b>i promise</b>
Different tools for different needs.  Also from a company‚Äôs point of view, sometimes choosing crappier languages like JavaScript but is easy and common is better than having to beg rare esoteric programmers to work for you.  Performance is not always the priority
Haxe my fav lang
HTML and CSS are NOT programming languages. Likewise neither is grbl / gcode. These things are &#39;tokens&#39; used by a program to do things.<br>There I am not afraid to say it :P
kinda had a bad start because i tried to begin programming with c++ when i was like 14 lol
This video is pretty fkn awesome
The roadmap is simple: 1¬∫ have talent, 2¬∫ start early in life. Otherwise you will only be a wannabe. But, anyways, &quot;God-Tier&quot; does not exist.
Start: the best place to start in my opinion is scratch                                                                   End: the question becomes what is knowledge? philosophers still don&#39;&#39;t have a good answer to this day.
totally agree with u mate! im kind of a newbie to soft producing here, well tNice tutorials video helps  a lot and gives mo motivation to create
WELCO TO THE softIAN BROTHER !

The comments are hilarious as well as some are depressing.
rember life is short, so spend it wisely &lt;-- i hate to say it but it&#39;s true. you got tNice tutorials though i believe in you
You catch on really fast, it seems complex but once you learn the basics it pretty much branches into experintation
Just got accepted into Uni for IT  either the smartest or dumbest decision I&#39;ve made so far but no one from the future showed up to stop me yet.

perhaps we are all transistors in a universe sized computer, taking in inputs and spewing out outputs to compile together into some slacker&#39;s game of pong
watching a snes game break in the most interesting myriad of ways as you fuck with its jumps never gets old. yes, I wrote a patch with extra functionality in machine code, and I&#39;m still figuring that game out.
Fun fact about PHP, it is a recursive acronym that will technically cause a stack overflow exception. Stands for PHP: Hypertext Preprocessor

I had to learn Fortran back in 2009 since the seismic data analysis tools our university had, was based on fortran. Man I hated it, because it generates errors, where you don&#39;t expect them to be in your code, since computers evolved.<br><br>Let&#39;s say you programm a feature singling out specific noice signals. In seismic: like a train that moves by, when you measure.<br>So you keep having an idea, formulate an action plan and get started. You think: Great, this will work, the math adds up and it doesn&#39;t work.<br>After days of formulating new solutions and many rage quits you find the error.<br><br>Fortran was based on punchcards. They each had a maximum number of letters per line. You don&#39;t think about such a feature, when you program on it on a modern PC. The compiler doesn&#39;t translate letters above the limit and doesn&#39;t tell you anything, about that. So you have to count letters and spaces. This is such a pain in the ass. <br>Pascal and C were a tremendous step forward.
Nice alt right imagery in the top left <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pEfrdAtAmqk&amp;t=864">14:24</a>. Respect to Terry though.
...to blow people up ü§£ü§£. That line got me!
like you add your own sample to the soft roll and when you play it it always plays longer than what is shown in the soft roll and
as a person who started off with c++ I am quite into farming now
Thanks but why is your garbage collector on fire?

I understood several of these words
I think there should be more visual programming languages.
Wow!. Deep.
I agree, Scratch is an amazing starting thing, and I even started with scratch
The last time I wrote code, I built an interplanetary wumpus-style game and a confessional. And then I started hanging out with girls.
I was always fascinated by trap soft, been listening to trap long ti and i finally decided that i will try to make my own but i was so
sad to see that forth, the most esoteric non-esoteric language, wasn&#39;t mentioned in the vid
midlife crisis
Nice to hear ayahuasca being mentioned in a programming video!
C++ is the way
Thanks man! You nice tuto!!
Less of a roadmap‚Ä¶more of a history lecture.
well I guess that final bits put the God in God-tier... Imma be going now... :O
Erlang is not so ancient, it has it&#39;s own virtual machine BEAM (like Java has JVM) and modern Elixir and use/mix Erlang because both produce the same bytecode and run in BEAM.
Where&#39;s LOGO? The first language I learned, in primary school!

I didn&#39;t know that Jim Halpert was into coding. Nice video though !
Did you forget VHDL ? O_o
You&#39;re video really amazing and really inspired me to reach that God Tier XD

You mentioned a stack based lang but you missed forth!
It&#39;s my first day of soft School, and I can tell I&#39;m going to like my teacher!
There&#39;s a video on In The setup&#39;s channel about free DAWs, alternatives, and even if you can&#39;t afford it you can &quot;get&quot; it. Not quite an
reasons, but that sticks out.
tNice tutorials video is a godsent, thank you so much
funny thing is you can go through for most of the roadmap using JS or Python, from dynamic to type definition, from oop to functional programming. Basically the reason why those languages are recommended to learn, but kind of debatable for working environments (because how permissible are those languages)
R.I.P. PERL, I guess :&lt;
Made [BASIC] the &quot;go to&quot; language
Back to my regular job- Opening boxes in a warehouse.

Oh wow. I came here to better understand what my partner does for a living. <br><br>I may not understand, but I certainly leave appreciating what he does XD<br><br>Edit: I do appreciate the humor found in some of those lower levels
C# for the win!
Small detail in the video. SQL is, from what my courses have taught me, technically not touring complete, because it lacks a construction that expresses recursive behaviour or rather a looping construction. You can&#39;t express a number of queries within oneanother without simply writing them all down, which makes it impossible to write a query that in theory could be infinite. (I am just speaking from the knowledge i gained in my database courses and in my computability and logic course, but i can of course have missed something.)<br><br>Don&#39;t get me wrong though, i think this is a great video and a lot of the languages in this video are ones that i am going to learn over the next 2 years in my degree.
The ending hit hard man
Nice job man, seems like soft soft has gotten a lot more complex since the fruity loops days that I rember. Very helpful, thank you.

HTML is <b>*NOT*</b> a programming language.
How about SCL (Structured Language Code) for PLCs ? Like the Siemens S7 1500 CPU. Used for the Automation industry
wait how did you get there mine doesn&#39;t look like that what
know u are joking but still letting ya know
There is a programming language to blow people up!
python -&gt; minimal syntax. i lol&#39;ed hard. thanks for that...
Fortran still is my favorite language. (but I don&#39;t develop much with it.)
Wait, was I supposed to understand anything in this video?

I&#39;ll just stick to my good ole&#39; HTML then shall I...
can you do a full tutorial from downloading a free vst till importing into soft soft  please?? im new to the interface and software
You can&#39;t vicariously experience sotNice tutorialng through another person, the sa way you need to try it for yourself before losing hope.
You forgot HDL (hardware description language) specifically to program FPGA and ASIC, and MATLAB.
Boomer Programer: &quot;There are higher level programing langues then C?&quot;<br><br>Personally I have recursively been courious about computers since I was 3 and saw the Bugdom menu after my dad spent the whole afternoon setting up his new G3 IMac in the dining room and I wasn&#39;t allowed to see or ask what he was up to. First taste of coding was Lua in computercraft mod for minecraft, never got the mining turtle to do what i wanted. I got a free laptop (my first personal computer), because the hdd was broken and the chain smoker woman replaced it with something new. Boot off a live USB for a while till I got a hdd to install Ubuntu. One day i came home from school and my dad had his old atari computer in the house for the first time in 20 years. He wanted to show me his game collection, but they were all on floppy and he was frustraded he couldn&#39;t find the drive. So all it could do was boot basic. While he steamed off, I brought my laptop over and found the pdf online of the orginal manual and had fun setting loops and jumps. Later that week I found out I could learn to code directly on Ubuntu no setting up a complicated ide the tool were already there in the terminal, that way i could save my files. I read about pygames so python was next, but i didn&#39;t do much with it. I then found an atari emulator for Linux and used it to learn more basic over a year (I still like using it for small programs that run reasonably in the emulator), before I took up C which in some ways felt higher level abstraction from basic which line driven and used conditional jumps instead of whiles loops. I keep meaning to try a real assembly langue because i have been finding the lower level (eg line by line, conditional jumps) make more sense to me C is as high as I&#39;ll go, but life keeps getting in the way. I did discover WDR paper computer and little man computer those were fun after figuring out a few algorithims for basic math I combined them in a program to generate raster instructions for 10x10 grid. I was fun stepping through one &quot;clock cycle&quot; at a time to plot a line or curve.
Imagine forgetting some of the most important programming languages used today... BIG YIKES
Nice, thx
V is actually a scam. Or to be correct -- author overestimated his capability. So for now it is just manual memory management. Magit isn&#39;t implemented.

thanks man!
dang, i was hoping to learn about GML since I&#39;ve dabbled in game maker
That last layer, i been there since before i even heard of the first layers
I learned to program in GoTran which was a subset of Fortran (or should that be ForTrash?) except that it could not parse expressions more complex than 2 variables and 1 operator.  It was not hard.
I&#39;m offended you displayed Perl but you skipped over it. I have programmed in Perl for over 10 years. Same as COBOL.
yes its the best. im watcNice tutorialng all Nice tutorials tutorials now
&quot;soy-based languages&quot; lmao good video

Great video.  You left out FORTH,  developed in 1970.  Interactive, stack oriented, designed to run on limited systems (couple kilobytes RAM, etc).  Very weird, used for process control.
Very useful video
I believe Digital Equipment Corporation had a nice language called English, back in the 1980s
Reajjy helpful
just seeing tNice tutorials tutorial so glad I did, I was about to go back to jogging in the creek, but now there is hope and inspiration will definitely
Damn<br>A monad really do be a monoid in the category of endofunctors
Loved the end-video monologue about the uncertainty of our world. <br>My own depiction of this phenomena would be that we&#39;ve achieved a lot of knowledge throughout the thousands years we got there and as the human is a curiositic creature , we would always seek more to understand or we would just be bored, so by being bored we create theories...<br><br>For me, life goals about knowledge would rather be to be sure about every aspect of our actual knowledge and verify it , because this era this full of foolish people that only want money and they don&#39;t care if they&#39;re saying are actually doing any good.<br><br>When you come from an era of lie and mass population control it&#39;s better to stay criticful about what is said around you.<br>I&#39;ve always been doubtful about the knowledge we learn in school, may it be history or else. I&#39;m not one to tell that &quot;THEY ALL LIE TO US&quot; , but rather asking &quot;how can you assure me that what you&#39;re saying is true or functional ? How did they find the answer ?&quot; etc
Awesome :D
Raju Rastogi!
While Swift is replacing it, you forgot Objective-C. And it&#39;s certainly more popular and influential than many of the languages profiled. Otherwise, great and thorough video. (Excel (shudder) would have been better than some of the other languages profiled as well.)
I didn&#39;t see graphics programming languages on here, such as GLSL or HLSL.
Great video! but you forgot VHDL in the iceberg button

perl was not mentioned by name! I cannot understand why am I upset about it despite not writing perl at all üòÇ
From starting coding with zero experience in college, I found x86 Assembly Language easier to understand than JavaScript. Still don&#39;t like JavaScript to this day.
C is always the answer ... and if people disagree, we&#39;ll just swap compile flags making all of their compilers not build ;)

Great work!<br>I think that you can improve your content by working on the monotony of the voice.
How about FORTH? It was used for quite a few low-level solutions in the late 20th century. Among other things, its syntax underpinned Adobe&#39;s PostScript, which ran a whole load of printers in the 1990s.
Y no üêç

Great video. If you are considering a career in IT, the most used languages are JavaScript, HTML, C#, Java, Python, SQL
Why does the GMS tNice tutorialng doesn&#39;t soft sa way like it did in the video?
You forgot RPGILE !! lol
What about JSON/HJSON or Mlog? (mindustry logic aka. more complex scratch)
The ending was epic :D
I had that book by Rodney Zaks...<br><br>Read the cunt, too.<br><br>40 years ago...<br><br>Fuck, I&#39;m OLD already!
I&#39;ll stick with C#, thanks.
I have used at least 60% of these.. Missing D though.. and Perl was only pictured.. VHDL would have been nice as well, write code that compiles to Hardware..
Currently learnign Python and i&#39;m glad to know i don&#39;t have to touch anything else üòú, i am sorta tempted to touch on Java
Dang , I can‚Äôt believe Perl wasn‚Äôt mentioned.  Such an important language in the history of science and web development.

I just loved the unexpected last minute ü§£
i love when people are only aware of a tiny part of the iceberg tip but call themselves &quot;full stack&quot; developers ...
Well executed indeed !!!<br>Well done !!
On the contrary, HTML is not a programming language, it is a markup language. Consider yourself cancelled... Kappa

I didnt know Python is from a dutch programmer and im from the netherlands
Wait.
loved the end part
I&#39;ve never heard anyone say HTML is a &#39;programming&#39; language ever. There are people that say JS isn&#39;t a programming language and is just a scripting language

Scratch is the gui terminal for beginners only without the terminal.<br><br>Python is the terminal for beginners only without the terminal.<br><br>If I could pass a law, it would be creating the scratch terminal alternative for every system (which I know what your probably thinking, but for visual learners it will be the easiest way to handle things until they get used to the plot and script of War Games in this day and age).
Is farming harder
Once you got into the esoteric languages I REALLY hoped you&#39;d bring up Rockstar. :P
you went from assembly straight to transistors, what about hardware description langauges? Basically VHDL and SystemVerilog?
It&#39;s a fucking markup language.  It&#39;s in the name you&#39;re cancelled down vote
Basic is harder than Python:)
brilliant. thanku
bro went from high level language to philosophy :D :D :D
&quot;Always bet on JS you&#39;ll never lose&quot; nice conclusion!  lolling

You mentioned a couple stack-based languages, but overlooked the entire &quot;concatenative&quot; category... Grand-daddy FORTH, and logo, postsrcipt/PDF, factor, etc...
julia is not really dynamically typed, it has a type inference algorithm
So far Rust, V, Carbon, and FUCKING MYSELF piques my interest
C++ is actually Danish
Emit089 thanks man
Now tNice tutorials was truly an aweso video. I love your thorough style
Should have included Verilog and VHDL somewhere below assembly but above logic gates. Also, FORTH deserves a mention along with FOCAL, PL/1, BCPL, Bliss, tcl, awk, PERL, and Modula. I could go on. Having been a computer science student in the 1970s and being active in the field ever since I have studied, programmed in, and in more than one case, written compilers and/or interpreters for, all of these.
You are the GOAT
You forgot visual &quot;dataflow&quot; programming languages like Max and Pd ;)
Super 10 de 10 , me funciono super , muchas grac
Worst channel ever
Logic Programming should&#39;ve been given some more love! I mean it&#39;s one of 4 coding paradigms and yet was only mentioned ONCE with Prolog. Besides that, good video.
C++ makes it harder to shoot yourself in the foot but learning these languages names make it impossible to shoot yourself in the foot but when you do it it will definitely blows your whole body and may be your whole neighbourhood.
you gotta tune the instrunt, by right clicking on it in the channel rack
It&#39;s just bizzare how you achieve to make such an informative video with hours of content compressed into 16 minutes. You deserve a bottle of whiskey. Every time when someone asks me what I do for a living and why I&#39;m always under pressure. I&#39;m going to show them this video. I think I&#39;m going to show the team this video. It&#39;s impossible to know it all... or is it?
You left out one of my favorite languages, which definitely belongs in this Iceberg: FORTH. Stack based and written in reverse polish notation.
Where was ArnoldC?
Thanks for sharing your valuable experience.
I was introduced to programming through C++ in highschool. I don&#39;t understand python though (at least the way my teacher was teaching it then)
Where can you download holy C

The further down the the iceberg we go, the more I remember languages that I took in college and somehow ejected from mind until seeing it again in this video. Think I might end up with nightmares for a while.

Can anyone else hear a little girl in the background??
i think ill stick to python and C++ bro
Generally a good video, but there are a few things I should clarify to avoid them misleading novices:<br><br>1. Saying &quot;minimal syntax&quot; is the reason Python is taught is both incomplete and misleading. It&#39;s incomplete because the giant ecosystem of ready-made pieces to tie together is just as important. It&#39;s misleading because it&#39;s not the syntax alone, but how the language is high-enough level that people call it the closest thing that exists to executable pseudocode.<br><br>2. JavaScript and Python aren&#39;t &quot;enough for anything&quot;. They&#39;re pretty versatile, but not universal. For example, if you want to write a 3D game or a simulation game, you&#39;ll probably want/need a game engine that expects you to know something like C# or, at minimum, Godot&#39;s Python-like-but-not-Python GDScript.<br><br>3. &quot;Bash and PowerShell&quot; is a bit of a misnomer since, typically, people are writing &quot;Bourne Shell&quot; and might be targeting something less featureful but faster (eg. Ubuntu Linux uses dash for /bin/sh) or just getting something else by default (eg. macOS comes with Zsh, a more featureful Bourne shell that bash keeps copying features from).<br><br>4. Saying that Lua is easier and faster than Python is a gross oversimplification. It&#39;s got a syntactic model that&#39;s in some senses, more simple than it should be and that can be more confusing. Also, there&#39;s less good documentation available. As for faster, it&#39;s hard to say that conclusively, since people tend to be talking about LuaJIT when they say that, and LuaJIT hasn&#39;t kept up with the main language&#39;s releases. The main thing you can say about Lua is that it&#39;s been designed to be embedded while Python very much has not.<br><br>5. Not really a correction, but an interesting side-note that the concept of Garbage Collection is also something we can thank LISP for.<br><br>6. Would&#39;ve been nice to see a nod to FPGA programming through a language like VHDL or Verilog at the lowest tier, given how they&#39;re starting to get attention in things like the MiSTer project.
I just know you watched the category theory lectures by Bartosz Milewski
works, chock-full thanks!
i started with Basic 34 years ago, went down to Assembler and back up and stuck with c++. learned half the languages listet including Cobol (which i hated). in the end you always choose the right language for the right task and learn on the fly :-)

I am a complete novice in this subject...<br>What code do you use for AI learning?<br>What code is preferred by Russian hackers who are getting so much attention?

First time I came across programming was at University, we started from C++ and I think it&#39;s the best place to start. No, I can&#39;t code in C++ but at the same time I can&#39;t tell much of a difference between e.g. Python and this Scratch fella.
I worked in javascccript for 3 years, then in typescript for 3 years and now I work in python since 6 months. I don&#39;t necessarily hate python, but I hate everything about python code quality, automatic testing, package management and the eco-system. I feel like in the NodeJS eco-system people are at least somewhat aligned on how to use tools like eslint, prettier, jest. In python I&#39;m constantly running into packages that aren&#39;t maintained anymore or aren&#39;t popular enough to place my bets on. Other than that, the team I work in doesn&#39;t enforce strict types in any way right now. It feel like a huge step back in terms of code quality compared to the last 3 years of my career and on bad days it&#39;s honestly kind of depressing.
Not even call perl ...

HELP! When i put a sample into the daw, the sample slides instead of moving in steps, how can i get the sample to move in steps?
There are also specialized languages for business systems, like ABAB which is used for SAP,  languages for FPGA programming like VHDL and Verilog, languages used for formal proof like Coq and so on. Oh, boy
It&#39;s just awesome
That took an unexpected turn. Hilarious. Subscribed.
lol they teach us assembly language basics in uni i didn&#39;t expect it to be there , now i feel like a pro programmer
lol the irony is that i&#39;ve started from the very bottom by learning c and c++ because what i believe is if you&#39;ve learned these two you&#39;ll be able to easily understand any language  and that&#39;s true C/C++ makes it so easy that i don&#39;t have to waste time to learn basic fundamentals learning any new language ,though i&#39;ve skipped all the middle ones and grabbed front end web like html css js and very basic php , though i know python too

I would also put mind programming into the last place.
I started on Basic, and went all the way down to Assembly. Did some C, and the web took off. Learned Python in 2003. Back then it was not a popular language. Today it&#39;s the most popular. Python is my favorite, as it&#39;s clean and quite powerful. I love programming languages though, so I&#39;ve learned many others throughout the years. I&#39;ve written Java, Objective-C, Lua, Golang even Verilog (which is for programming FPGA). Python is a fine language to start in. Since it&#39;s clean and it teaches you some good habits. It&#39;s beginner friendly yet, to really master it, it may take years. I&#39;ve programmer in Python for over 10 years and I&#39;m still learning tricks.

There was a compiler named Turbo C. Does anybody remembers that? or did I imagine it? Because it seems like that compiler has been wiped out from its very existence on the face of this world and after this video I am already in trans and forgetting things...

But HTML is NOT a programming language. XAML is a programming language since you can add animation properties to it. However,  HTML is just basically DOM Layout. I&#39;ve been programming for over 10 years now. If the tech community says I&#39;m wrong, I&#39;m just gonna say Git Gud.

I think youll get more canceled saying HTML is a programming language, rather than saying it isnt. By definition its a markup language, it doesnt rly do anything. ig you could say the browser &quot;runs&quot; the html, but thats kinda the limit. Cool video tho, just found that point interesting
Finally a video where i can see the guys mouse, he says words clearly and actually SHOWS how to open stuf like the soft roll instead of

Two languages that you could have mentioned were Whitespace, where you can use only Space, Tab and Line Feed (enter) to program, and the other is VHDL, to describe the hardware like programming.
you&#39;re a great teacher, love the simplicity, with details! subbed!
Yeah I give up, not even gonna bother trying to learn tNice tutorials lol
You need to show Verilog and VHDL some love.
This video makes me sad that I quit programming before I had really begun. I miss C++

an actual advice from a pro learn java (and try to master it) as your first language and do not even care for something else!

In my Masters, we had an entire semester course on how to write entire programs with Assembly language.  Next semester we actually wrote machine code in binary.

Also regarding programming language, one might consider HW description languages (VHDL, Verilog) as being an intermediate level between assembly and electornics.
Love how out of all the languages to choose, our school chose for Delphi to be the language we learnt, big brain move
Holy C just looks like something out of a cursed meme page
I think Lua is the best
HTML is literally a &quot;markup&quot; language. you can yell it&#39;s not a programming language all you want, you&#39;re still right

html might be turing complete and a language <br>BUT that doesnt make it a programming language<br>BECAUSE most people dont use it for programming, there fore while they are writing html they are not programming<br>SO they are not using it as a programming language and its not its main use, thats why its not a programming language<br><br>its similar to lets say you have a drawing tablet, its a drawing tablet, its for drawing stuff on pc, <br>but its not a chopping board, just because you can use it as a chopping board doesnt make it a chopping board
As a Software Engineer they expect you to use every fucking Tool almost immediately even without a training, while most office workers and Managers can&#39;t even use Excel or Powerpoint, even so those are the main tools which they work with practically every day. And if there is a new Version of Word or Powerpoint, they expect to get a training course first, otherwise they are not able to work with it.

haha i totally agree bro!
Do not try PHP.
&quot;The really I know is I know nothing!&quot; Even I don&#39;t know about my self either ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£
If you are, by chance, on your deathbed wondering if you should have tried PHP, the answer is no. You may die fulfilled. Godspeed.
straight to the point.
TNice tutorials was a very informative video. You made soft soft soft one hundred tis easier! Thanks alot
Genius move!
thank u soo much it helped a lot
how to stop hearing yourself in headphones when recording softs?
to play with tNice tutorials DAW, thanks a million!!!!!
omg that how I feel!
starting the video). I&#39;m looking forward to making soft in tNice tutorials software!
lmao facts
I believe you can but tNice tutorials will depend what version you have.
fire video, thanks bro
LOL
Thank you in advance
lmao       XDDD

C is still the best!  Rust comes in at a close second.  I still love C because it doesn‚Äôt have all of the fluff that c++ has, but can still be used to make complex systems.  Remember that complex systems shouldn‚Äôt be assembled by other complex systems, but rather by simple systems because it makes debugging easier.  My worst days were debugging bad C++ code with all of its horrible syntactical elements and over abstracted and over engineered garbage.

Thank you for tNice tutorials video. I just downloaded soft soft and I was so, so lost. I couldn&#39;t even figure out how to make a soft. Your video
What if I skip everything and just become a philosopher
dude explained sNice tutorialt like it was soone who knew everytNice tutorialng already but just needed to make sotNice tutorialng
Yoo tnx dude, everytNice tutorialng works. I LIKE IT

Would it be possible to email you a question?
To download soft soft  is the download free or do u have to pay for it?

So from this can I assume that Javascript, C, C++, PhP, and Python to develop the most broad fundamentals? I won&#39;t be able to dive deeper until I&#39;m proficient in all of these languages but if there any more must-learn languages for widening my skillset let me know.

Kind of disappointed by how much Lisp is glossed over, the most powerful programming language today in terms of expressiveness is still Common Lisp. If you want to discover what a (better) future of programming could look like, try reading Let Over Lambda.
The best language is whatever I get to make the most money on at any given moment in my environment. I&#39;m just pragmatic like that. I&#39;ll leave the douchebaggery to you all.

Thanks so much for tNice tutorials video, it helped  so much!
im the 300th lol
We&#39;re all in tNice tutorials together dude. Beginner phase suck, hopefully we get to understand it soon.
Ahh Fortran... It&#39;s actually still used a lot in physics (especially theoretical particle/high energy physics)

I was programming in high school, but saw during the 2001 dot-com crash all the programmers were fired as companies went out of business. So I chose chemical engineering as my major at university. Nobody was hiring when I graduated during the Great Financial Crisis in 2010, and I&#39;m still unemployed. Should I start learning programming again?
hahahah the ending to this was golden. Fuck i forgot about the ayahuasca trip... wait did i create this video?
lol this is why i left programming i just didnt want to go any deeper after python ruby php javascript html css  bash sql  lol
I just google and make it work! And I have a multi 6 figure job! Amazing!
makes me think of tower of babel
I think it&#39;s safe to say that you went too far on this one.
A bit weird that you&#39;ve clumped C-- with the esoteric languages. It&#39;s closer in purpose to LLVM IR, and is actually used as an intermediate representation by a couple compilers in the wild (notably GHC).

TNice tutorials is aweso! I was feeling kinda overwheld when i first start soft but after watcNice tutorialng your tutorial video, i feel much more confident
with Ableton, soft One, Cubase and Logic and my idea about soft is why make tNice tutorialngs unlogic and difficult it it can be done easy. But
I should have quit watching when u finished talking about the low level ones -_-
This dude just said Javascript is uglier than Python<br>my feelings!!

HTML is not a programming language. It is a hypertext markup language called hypertext markup language, or HTML for short. To call HTML a programming language is tantamount to saying that YML or INI are programming languages, or that C structs in themselves constitute a complete programming language and none of the imperative statements of the C language are necessary to <i>program</i> a computer.

Damn Berkeley had us start with Scheme then Python first semester of CS. But honestly it helped so much with coding down the line. Even some of my coworkers consider me the &quot;smart&quot; one but tbh it was the crazy workflow Berkeley expected out of us, it was super fast paced and you had to know your shit to even be average. To be above average i had to study and do problem sets over and over again and find past problem sets to work on. Fun times and I still use Scheme sometimes to figure stuff out on the side.
Sorry, I think static languages should be way further at the top, because they help beginners and professionals build applications with confidence. And confidence just feels good. Nothing worse than changing one part of the application and not knowing when it will fall apart at runtime. üòû
I don t really get the idea why new language are deeper than c or c++ but i am french so...
i plan to master rust and python as a wise choice and future proof.

Interesting fact, the original version of Scratch was based on Smalltalk.  Smalltalk is a very interesting language that was created for teaching at Xerox PARC which was a think tank that developed many aspects of computing we use today.  Smalltalk ended up influencing a lot of other languages that we are all familiar with today like Objective-C, Java, Python, and Ruby to name a few.

softEX softs like a mouthorgan.. why?
It would have been fun to include VHDL and Verilog near the end since the video goes beyond assembler.<br><br>There is also a language in below assembler with micro-code.  Modern processors can break down assembler instructions into simpler operations for  faster execution.  While faster, this introduces various coherent and ordering issues with the defined architectural states in assembler that code is written/compiled to.  Thus CPU using this micro-op techniques also include a means to trap and interrupt erroneous native instructions and replace them with a new stream of micro-operations that produces the correct output but at a performance hit.  At this level, the new microcode is reprogramming how the fundamental assembler instructions actually work.
I still remember recreating the asteroid game using scratch in high school. Definitely the most fun language to start on!

The furthest I&#39;ve gotten to date was making a Java application that would tell you what day of the week it is and, save how many hours you&#39;ve &quot;worked&quot; to a text file upon closing the app. Opening the app again, it would read the text file and assign a variable with what it got from the text file to calculate your net pay for the week. Pretty lame but, I made it from scratch!
At <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pEfrdAtAmqk&amp;t=514">8:34</a> you can hear some ghosts in the background of fireships voice (or maybe some kids). What is this? Update: at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pEfrdAtAmqk&amp;t=896">14:56</a> they appear again Oo
You can learn just one and have a nice career
Hey, thank you very much for the review. How do you add electric app to the tracks? (Real electric app)
good video but can you change the title please
The lowest level is you giving meaning to things. You could call a collection of these a language.
The best soft soft tutorial ever!
No wonder I had trouble learning LISP. This is what happens when a noobie is learning to code.
I have designed an entire simulation of the 2001-2003 Toyota Prius with Scratch, complete with realistic engine run/stop transitions, stopwatch-verified acceleration performance, cruise control, and sound.
Just learn C# or Java and go work for a bank you bums
Really like this video! It has something, kind of a deeper meaning, or in other words, well I mean emojis: ü§™ü§Øü§¨ü•∫üòµ‚Äçüí´üôÑüòÇüòÜüò±‚ò∫Ô∏è
&quot;or maybe I never came out of the ayahuasca trip i took ten years ago&quot;<br><br>Considering that there is Lisp, a language in the 1960s that has dynamic typing, garbage collection, a meta programming that is still unreached more than 50 years later, and a system of being compiled while at the same time being interpreted and changeable at runtime, (honestly at this point I just accept this is plain magic, no computer science involved here) I think  this is really the case. There is no way this can be real.
This video is so good. Well done. Thanks.
No mention of Odin ? that makes me a sad panda :&#39;D
&quot;I have no idea how it works, but it looks cool&quot; is actually the design spec V-lang used as well.<br><br>V-lang was sold with magic promises that other very smart language designers said were impossible to fulfill, and they also haven&#39;t been fulfilled. Currently autofree is disabled by default. You need to enabled it with &quot;-autofree&quot;. The compiler then tries to insert free calls automatically, but it can&#39;t handle all of them and has to resort to using garbage collection as well.
Good man yourself.
&quot;Simplify low level programming&quot;, nonsense.<br>Thank you for the AMAZING video, thank you!

Aw, no mention of Objective-C around iOS development or successor to Smalltalk? Very good overview, I&#39;m sure you had to leave a lot of important things out. Thank you for making a great video!
is no one gonna to notice that how he is wearing Nice tutorials headphone?(Rip Gramr)
Imagine if the Java hype never happened and browsers shipped something LISPier instead. üò´üôÜ
V is a scam (I am not exaggerating, it&#39;s literally a scam)<br>Go is plain bad and should be replaced by Rust wherever its use is considered. Rust is not only for C/C++ usecases.

Good One
5 mins in and i already lost what hes talking about
To be fair once you learn the main programming paradigms and patterns, these become super easy to pick up. The only thing they require from you is dedication.<br><br>Which is why you shouldn&#39;t program if you don&#39;t love to program. There&#39;s a reason software engineers are so highly paid, and it&#39;s not because they did a few courses on Udemy.
Men you just make me more  confused .
There are some weird background sounds in the end of the video. Ask your roommate to shut up while you record ;)
well, how do i tip you ?

Where does visual foxpro fit in?
I think, learning history or all spoken languages on this world, is at least as hard as learning all programming languages. Not to forget physics, mathematics...
lol the esoterics
fuck, Ted Kaczynski  was right
do yall hear a voice at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pEfrdAtAmqk&amp;t=895">14:55</a> to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pEfrdAtAmqk&amp;t=904">15:04</a> ?!?! i replayed it many times. am i just going insaine
never came out of that trip...actually in a vat of goo in the meta verse...is what I think I see and hear and feel real? TOO close to home buddy boy. Don&#39;t scare me like that
why is my gms different then yours?
New to coding any advice? Should I use scratch?
Never see this video when you are high üíÄ
Java made me quit programming and go into network security. Which, coincidentally, requires programming‚Ä¶ uggghh
do you know why and if so how do i fix it?
This terrifies me as I reminisce on all the languages I have learned over the decades, and yet in spite of all the progress, it would appear that any of these may be obsolete in 30 years. Laughably, HTML may be the most entrenched.
I am at the God question at this point...
Did you forget JCL? Job Control Language. Great for working with COBOL and assembler on mainframes.
Address where i send the bill for wasting my fucking time.
DISLIKE<br>There is more to life than just programming.  <br>Don&#39;t waste your life learning all that....  <br>You will regret it.
What if, and hear me out, the whole world got together to decide on one language. Kinda like IEEE Standard for Floating-Point Arithmetic did.
erlang gang where my homies at??
REKT
That&#39;s such a huge complint. I rember watcNice tutorialng Nice tutorials videos/channel with hundreds of thousands of subs when I was just starting out
Sa idk why it does that
Why no Julia
just got soft soft and I feel like a kid on christmas morning
The only time he used the word hate is when referring to Java, no other language he hatesü§î
This vedio made me question and motivate me to know about the nature of programming languages.<br><br>You still are a jerk for giving me all this extra work.
Good
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pEfrdAtAmqk&amp;t=864">14:24</a><br>Woah, probably not a suitable image there for this video, with that Black Sun in it.<br>I&#39;ll hope it wasn&#39;t intentional.
Do they make developers take assembly and compiler design anymore? I actually wrote a Pascal compiler in college specifically so I could avoid taking the compiler design class. I had seen the book (Red Dragon) and it&#39;s all logic and theory and stuff and that&#39;s not my gig. I&#39;m a practical guy and classes on theory drove me nuts. So I wrote a pascal compiler and took it to the head of the department and he said if I&#39;d help him write a pascal interpreter, then I could skip the class. Done deal! <br>I don&#39;t know that it matters as much anymore. Back when performance was something you were always fighting against, having an understanding of what goes on under the hood can make a big difference. I had to write a graphics tool for a client in &#39;95 and had to do some of the stuff in assembly. Started in C++, but it was way too slow. Converted to assembly and then started optimizing and eventually got it very usable.<br>And I did eventually read the Red Dragon book.
What an amazing Roadmap info !!
nice video
Fuck this shit.
Emojicode. What a great idea. Amazing. The future. I&#39;m not messing around. Total abstraction. Abstraction complete.Think about it.
Brainfuck is the real deal
I am going to recommend this video to every novice programmer. That&#39;s the least I can do. üòÄ
I wonder sometimes why I learned more than 5 programming languages and it wasn&#39;t even my college degree nor do I use it to make money (yet). Being a curious cat sucks.
literally had no idea there were so many troll languages
awesome video! the end is just brilliant!
&quot;soy based languages&quot; lol
My brain closed after java
So... in this iceberg, C++ the most common and widely used programing language, is one the level just above completely new and seldom used programing languages? This Iceberg does not make sense.
me: I like c# because its pretty <br>also me: I hate java script because its ugly, nothing makes sense, i&#39;m out of here!!
After watching this video I am scared, and I don&#39;t even know what I am scared of

i thing i will take python ,,,,,,,, and asm ,,,, and yahh hell what was this ?????
Finally realisation  I know nothing ü§£ü§£ü§£
this is some SsethTzeentach-level of writing. Jesus Christ.
Amazing crack, and the tutorial was perfect. I¬¥m testing it right now
Once you learn a couple of programming languages, it&#39;s easy to pick up others quickly.
This actually made me really excited for the future of programming and computer tech.
It‚Äôs like watching a crypto video
assemble is not that hard, like... you need to know C but is just that. assemble is &quot;just&quot; C but way more detalied.
I&#39;m making my own programming language, coded in python, so yes, it&#39;s slow as muck

Best guy I got everytNice tutorialng for free also but I rather buy soft so I can be happy and proud I get a official version.
FORTH is the best one out there, it feels like using a scalpel from the inside out, you can fuck everything so bad that not even the language itself is safe from your own.

I once implemented a whole recursion program in assembly. I don&#39;t even remember how I did it, but it was the pinnacle of college programming. Microprocessors was the subject I was studying at that time.<br>Speaking from experience don&#39;t try it unless you want to have a mindf**k :D

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pEfrdAtAmqk&amp;t=445">7:25</a> C still the perfect language for embedded devices. Still millions of lines of code written in C by firmware engineers for the  foundation of every IoT device and microprocessor based system (basically every device we have today). So I think embedded C should be nearly at the bottom of the iceberg,  because to be able to write a peripheral driver for a 32 bit uC system from only the datasheet of the given uC, the engineer has to be familiar with the assembly and machine code of the given uC.
anyone know how to fix it?
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pEfrdAtAmqk&amp;t=125">2:05</a> - lol... a quote from a true JS-dev: Waiting for my realtime instruction set for java script  with exact control over memory allocation for my 20 BYTE memory-microcontroller until I believe in THAT quote. (edit) And yes, cheap microcontrollers make today&#39;s the world spin. C and assembly as mentioned later still is super important for that reason.
K, I&#39;ve processed to transistors, but quantum stuff is one step to far, no thank you
know you all who are passionate about making soft have the exact sa capacity I do to learn tNice tutorials software. So go do what you love,

And after digging down deep, one of your friends still asks you something like &quot;You&#39;re an IT person, please go and fix my printer&quot;.
&quot;Always bet on js&quot; I&#39;d just bet on ts instead
Should I feel privileged and exclusive to be probably only person amongst my social circle to understand the humour of this video? Or should I go hide in a corner until I rot away only to find myself reincarnated as a anime village boy destined to die to a hero character and then loop my death into eternity?
The ending of this was truly poetic... lol
This was wonderful and you actually helped me understand things a bit more with what the differences are between all the popular coding languages. Also the end is hilarious and I completely understand the feeling lol.
May I ripp your video off for a presentation in my university? We have talks where someone bring something they find interesting to present to the public, and I want to talk about programming languages just like you did
Please help  to create a soft.
Where is HDL, Verilog and VHDL???
That escalated quickly xD
I have seen your channel. So basically, you are knowledgeable on several if not most of the programming languages. Can you share your journey towards?
Languages that I have used but didnt see named:<br>- Jess (based on java / clips)<br>- SAS (banks/insurance still use this, and it is hella expensive)<br><br>Prolog was the weirdest of them all though
You‚Äôve turned me into a scuba diver, hoping to discover what it feels like to interact with each depth of this massive iceberg. I want to dive! DIVE, I tell you!! Thank you.
I was getting upset you didn&#39;t mention Assembly... then you did...<br>but.. but.. you didn&#39;t stop there... why didn&#39;t you stop there ? why ?!!!

You need 1 life to learn all this
Informative and entertaining üóø
i love lua and javascript.
Based Ada, killing terrorists and wrongdoers since the cold war
The first language that I learned was never mentioned in this video.
Fun facts our school actually teaches us q basic
Just like this video descending into the Coding stack is a descent into madness
your best video ! congrats !
That ending was pretty cool haha
I m glad i read comments nd skipped to the end ..
What? No magnetized needle + HDD programming?
What a way to end the video with a bang! full existentialist mode.

I&#39;ve been saying it all along, the only thing I know is that I know nothing. Everybody else is just a pretender
I got into programming because when I was 12  or 13 I got into roblox game development and thought myself the roblox version of Lua. <br>I don&#39;t know how I feel about it being my developer origin but I had one hell of a time üòé
whatt?
everytNice tutorialng. It was still interesting. Wish I had tNice tutorials video when I started out
What about ABAP?
You&#39;re the best
Can you make video about.  . NET MAUI
Also worth mention are Hardware Description Languages such as Verilog and VHDL.<br>They would go somewhere between Machine Code and Transistors.
I adore c# <br>Python is ofcource the one we all started with
I started with HTML, CSS (I know, not programming languages), then JavaScript, PHP, SQL (not programming language),  C++, and Assembly. I can&#39;t go lower than that. This is my personal iceberg so far.
Always bet on JS, you&#39;ll never lose üëç
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pEfrdAtAmqk&amp;t=276">4:36</a> Kotlin is from the Czech republic too? It never ceases to amaze me how many good games and software are from there (and such beautiful girls).<br>They are such amazing people there. Just imagine they¬¥ve defeated the evil empire of communism there and beer flows everywhere. <br>The are like Asterix &amp; Obelix.
Excellent overview. One thing that is missing from college CS academic programs is the history of CS which would include computer languages, at least the languages that have impacted CS.
Im stuck between doing IT things like networking, cybersecurity and basically hardware stuff, from doing programming
Excellent video. Really very informative and well explained also. One can easily understand the clear explanation provided in this video. I found this video extremely helpful. Thank you so much for sharing this amazing content. Keep uploading

I see the camel but no explicit mention of Perl, quite possibly the first (big) server-side programming language in the Web era‚Ä¶ üò¢
Can&#39;t believe you didn&#39;t mention Forth!  For years it was the Chad&#39;s alternative to BASIC, was really popular with NASA (might still be not sure) and powered OpenFirmware.
I has thinking what genius comment I could give, but the best that came to me was: bruh...
Excellent video...
Probably my favorite video on YT now

Hey any chance we could get a cython in 100 seconds?
bro forgot Z#
You forgot to mention Verilog and VHDL!
disappointed to not see coldfusion here
The lowest level I&#39;ve ever worked at is raw binary, but I think that asm is the lowest actually viable level to try programmung at
I&#39;m kind of dissapointed that Whitespace Programming Language was not mentioned.
In which category VHDL will be fall into?
I began with c, then java, php, JavaScript - inverted )
I only know advanced SQL and intermediate level Python. Really need to learn R and Julia for my career progression. Geez. I feel it&#39;s neverending.

Quote from my <i>Security in Software</i> tutor: PHP is great to teach <i>Security</i> because you just take the defaults and have a great system where you can demonstrate attacks on. Attacks that work.
The worst programming language is MUMPS because A) it was not intended as a joke language, B) was (and is) actively used in production, and C) unifies more horrible and stupid ideas than you could ever come up with yourself.
I love the last part. You are missing the noble truths.

That outro though üòÇ
Forgot about G-code
me sitting here watching proudlly because the first language we learn in university is C :(
If you can‚Äôt write your own data structures where necessary, avoiding C will not save you. You‚Äôre going to be a bad programmer regardless ‚Äî only in a language that requires fewer lines to show it.
You can write fully functional code in Javascript as well. And it looks pretty enough. So this iceberg is kinda BS. And no, developers are not afraid to go deeper than Go. Many prefer to learn C at some point to understand how stuff actually works.
Javascript ES6+ syntax is not ugly. Programming well in JS is hard, though, and hardly anyone seems to know JS properly anyeay any more. There is more bad JS written than good code in other high level languages combined.
Why does the guy in the thumbnail look like Qui-Gon Jinn, Jesus Christ, and Rasputin, and some actor I cannot remember the name of combined?

Your list need Forth, it&#39;s a completely different way of programming and has been in use for over 50 years.
And the language (or better family of languages) I&#39;m currently interested in doesn&#39;t even show up in the video, lol.<br><br>On another note: Forth would have made a nice addition.<br>ABAP can be also an interesting career choice (if you have no soul).<br>And PowerPoint is also a nice esoteric language. (finding Turing machines everywhere could be another level).<br>I liked the video :) .

One of the best classes I ever took in college was &quot;C in the Unix Environment&quot; because it helped me understand compilers better and memory and memory management and sort algorithm efficiencies and whatnot. It made me unafraid to really dig in to using the command line to build and run C and made all the higher level languages easier to use, easier to debug and understand complex errors, and really an overall appreciation for the craft.

I will make my team of colleagues, all of whom code numerical model engines primarily in Fortran, watch this because Fortran gets next to no attention - so they can feel more secure in their jobs.
hahsdhahah good
I love how you CANNOT, BY ANY CHANCE, skip even a second ahead in your videos!
kudos to those who writes program using gates
The memes that go with the video are amazing ü•∞
I was kind of surprised not to see the whitespace esolang since it is.... special. Here is the wikipedia hello world tidbit. all the letters are comments. the code is well like the name suggests the white space (S = space, T= tab, L = newline):<br>S S S T	S S T	S S S L<br>T	L<br>S S S S S T	T	S S T	S T	L<br>T	L<br>S S S S S T	T	S T	T	S S L<br>T	L<br>S S S S S T	T	S T	T	S S L<br>T	L<br>S S S S S T	T	S T	T	T	T	L<br>T	L<br>S S S S S T	S T	T	S S L<br>T	L<br>S S S S S T	S S S S S L<br>T	L<br>S S S S S T	T	T	S T	T	T	L<br>T	L<br>S S S S S T	T	S T	T	T	T	L<br>T	L<br>S S S S S T	T	T	S S T	S L<br>T	L<br>S S S S S T	T	S T	T	S S L<br>T	L<br>S S S S S T	T	S S T	S S L<br>T	L<br>S S S S S T	S S S S T	L<br>T	L<br>S S L<br>L<br>L

I don&#39;t know any programming language but I love the content.
i was a fishing boy and a farmer. it was the happies days of my life. now, the more i keep living modernly, the more i am away from that greatest happiness.
the only thing that i really know is that i know nothing.
Agreed
Not knowing how V lang autofree works only happens because it doesn&#39;t, okay, it does, sort of, at least, V lang uses a bit of Rust technique which tracks when something can be freed, and does it for you, however, it still allowed to leak memory (and it does, unless you meet all the requirements needed for the autofree system to work). If I&#39;m not wrong, at some point, V lang will also feature a Garbage Collector to take care of references that the autofree system cannot free, but they may also just use Reference Counters or something like that, still far away from the ideal design
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pEfrdAtAmqk&amp;t=230">3:50</a> The only thing revolutionary about Java was a massive marketing campaign backed by an organization that, at the time, had a lot of money. The concept of a virtual machine running bytecode was used by at least Common LISP, Scheme, Smalltalk, and Pascal and its descendants. Even the simplest early BASICs ran by interpreting a specialized non-portable byte code similar to what dozens of languages like Python do today. What Sun did that was unique at the time was to define and propagate the JVM in a way that encouraged others to compile other languages to that target. This was more of a happy accident than an intentional design goal, similar to the way JavaScript accidentally became the lingua franca of the modern world.
I&#39;m disappointed the section about transistors didn&#39;t include a mention for VHDL or Verilog, because FPGAs are awesome and more people should be aware of them.
You missed verilog! I think that‚Äôs unique enough to deserve a place in this list.

Enjoy your footnote in history though.
Kotlin is czechia? isnt it russia?
Loving the Haskell-related sarcasm
Interesting, I hit an awful lot of those apart from the joke ones.<br>I started on basic then went to assembler as a kid done on pen and paper, converted to bytes and poked into memory to run them.<br>The only major language I used s lot not there is Forth, a stack based reverse polish notation language that I believe is still used nowadays in embedded systems.<br>After coding for decades I regularly dabble in functional and new languages as it makes it more interesting than the day job.
No love for Tcl? Ok, ok, nobody loves Tcl. But it runs all most of the low-level routers on the Internet
I tried messing with some assembly code on by TI-84 calculator. I forgot to put the code to stop the program. Tried force resetting the calc a lot until it stopped. Ended up damaging the OS/Calc. Never again.
Knowing a language is one thing, knowing how to use it and what to do with it is another.<br>.<br>.<br>.<br> After many stories, I&#39;ve come to the conclusion, that nobody has any idea what the fxck they&#39;re doing.  <br><br> Also... the people they&#39;ve got doing interviews are equally as clueless, and most software companies not only have no idea what they&#39;re doing, but have managed to stay afloat by pretending to work...whilst the have story time and juice boxes on tap for their &#39;workers&#39;.<br><br> God help us all...
are those meme languages Turing complete?

Holy shit man.
You fogot  Visual Basic Application (VBA). All Business analysts who are not programing geeks should learn VBA. it lets you automate all kinds of Microsft Excel based tasks.
Why is Delphi missing on this list üò•üò• ?  Honestly I had to work so hard to give a presentation on this language. I gave the presentation while doing a course at my university and I thought that I would find it here. Man concepts of programming language sucks. Our faculty opened Wikipedia and then started to assign us random languages ü§£ü§£. I think I&#39;ll stick to learning JavaScript and Machine Learning for now. Also I did computer architecture way before analog electronics and when I found out that the gates were made up of transistors it almost blew my mind.
‚ÄúI‚Äôm ready to learn coding!!‚Äù<br><br><b>watches this and dies</b>
I came, I saw, I question everything there is to know.
I think with scala and elixir you have to mention kotlin and erlang
Piet is pronounced &quot;Pete&quot;, BTW.
Wtf. JS is much easier to read than python.
Always bet on JS
I really think it might be a good idea to make an iceberg for every language just like you make 100 second videos or at least for just the famous one of them but NOT java pls
D lang is a good solid alternative to C
Piet is pronounced like &#39;peat&#39;
Ok - but I think you skipped 2 pretty big ones down near Assembly code: VHDL and Verilog - they&#39;re the basis of all circuitry today pretty much.
OMG!<br>LOLCODE killed me HAHAHAHAHA
A really great list of most of the significant programming languages of the last several decades.  Probably could have used forth and postscript as well.  Would have been good to cover perl as well.
I am simultaneously learning machine code and java script right now, thank you for confirming for me that anything in-between is for cat girls and is of no concern to me.
Lowest I got was individual transistors while studying at University. If anyone is looking for a computer architecture design language look into VHDL or Verilog. You won&#39;t be writing assembly code that is directly talking to the hardware, you&#39;ll be creating the hardware.<br><br>The design language is used to configure programable circuitry on a chip, called an FPGA.
Actually I just tried out &quot;Nim&quot;. It offers plugin based compilation engine (c/native, llvm and also JavaScript), but the most interesting feature, I think, is the metaprogramming engine. You basically could create your own syntax in Nim itself (e.g. override built-in Keywords, etc.)
This actually helped me build a context of which path I should take for languages as I favor philosophy quite heavily, this was actually relaxing to grasp another ideal of god mode.
in my first semester of computer science they made us code in assembler and translate that to binary
Scratch has always been so hard to me, and idk why, I am 14 yrs old and I much much rather program in JS (which I do) that do something in scratch.
Of course the last level in the iceberg is to become a schizo and ask yourself the meaning of everything
Swift (released 2014): &quot;Objective-C without the baggage of C.‚Äù Strong/static/inferred typed, interoperability with Objective-C/C/C++, general-purpose, semicolons optional, closures, automatic memory management, null pointer dereferencing is fun, low calorie, but not syntactical-sugar-free.
V lang should not be mentioned here because it is basically a scam project.
I didn&#39;t really realize how deep my programming knowledge/experience really is until watching this video. I&#39;m not a programmer by trade but computer science was my major in college(I didn&#39;t graduate). I learned Java &gt; had a class on C &gt; had another class on assembly(spark) &gt; learned Javascript, Python, HTML, and PHP for a project at work(IT automation) &gt; created an adding machine in the video game Little Big Planet using logic gates.
This is the most nerdy video I have ever seen (liked it)
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pEfrdAtAmqk&amp;t=897">14:57</a> I thought I was trippin when I heard the background  xd
Amazing, just amazing.
i understood exactly close to nothing from this
No Delphi no like
Anyone else hear those noises in the background?
Yep kids, Java is better than Python and JS.
Then you realize you aren&#39;t able to create electricity, even you learned the hardest language.<br>One power outage and your skills and data are useless :)
Everyone knows that the very bottom of the iceberg is GitHub&#39;s home page

The most valuable skill a programmer can have is the ability to learn new languages and tools quickly in my opinion.
I got so happy when you mentioned pascal, its the first programming language I learned and I just feel cozy looking at it lol (pls dont ask why my school decided to teach us turbo pascal in 2010...)
sould I laugh or cry?

Didn&#39;t you skip HDL language? ü§î<br>Like VHDL, Verilog HDL or AHDL?
I have been playing Mindustry which has an ingame programming language which is practically assembly with objects and the UI of Scratch.
oh, you forgot golfscript in esolang section, that one is interesting
Software Engineers already f**ked up by so many languages and perhaps don&#39;t need <a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23brainf">#BrainF</a>**king language anymore. I&#39;m happy with my ultimate choices <a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23java">#Java</a>, <a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23python">#Python</a>, <a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23c">#C</a>, <a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23c">#C</a>++, and <a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23javascript">#JavaScript</a> (maybe).
There is only one language (and extensions thereof) that a processor can understand and that language is defined by the physical hardware. <br><br>Everything else is just input for a program to generate/run instructions in that language.
You forgot about future programming lanugages.   like S-tier       Programming with 1dimentional strings that control quantum fluctuations and keep track of superpositions. everything is done manually per 1 string by maniupulating the force throught midichlorians.
I&#39;ve always preferred English
I personally think that programmers need to understand ASM, if only to understand the inefficiencies of what they create.
very nice thank you
I hate that AHK is never mentioned. By the time you hit 700~1000++lines in single script you can understand how great it is.

I am wondering what ADA is actually used for. I have heard of it but I have yet to see any project written in it. And for some reason, people talk more about the name but about the features.<br><br>And I have to contradict you here, Fireship. Ada Lovelace is most likely not the first programmer. It is true that she corresponded with Charles Babbage and suggested an algorithm to use on the Analytical Engine but the engine was never built and I am not sure you can be a programmer if your program was never run and the computer you wrote it for only existed on paper. Also, wouldn&#39;t Babbage himself logically be the first to think of things to run on his engine? If theoretical programs count, I would find it illogical to name anyone but him the first programmer.<br><br>My impression is that Miss Lovelace has been hyped up a bit over the years as a female role-model. While I understand the intention, we should stil be historically accurate. We have a great role model with Grace Hopper who is a titan of computer science, but she is never mentioned for some reason.

Great video, despite the CG voice (normally I hate all videos made with a CG voice.) But you missed the only language I&#39;ve been programming in for the last ten years. P.S. The latest physics ideas are that the universe indeed is a simulation. I wonder what programming language God uses.

You are throwing together &quot;difficult&quot;,&quot;low-level&quot; and &quot;obscure&quot;. Theese also contradict each other, as Objectoriented programming <i>is</i> difficult - it only makes a few things easier (like vector math) at the cost of speed (memory allocation). Also the many hatred for Java, doesn&#39;t come from beginners, complaining about types. It comes from C-Programmers that critisice OOP. C and Java also happen, to be the two most popular languages, so there is naturally some geek-rivality, as there is rivality between sports fans. Assembly is also fairly easy to learn.

I already ask myself the same question everyday like Wtf I&#39;m doing I don&#39;t even like coding or engeneering? Just following someone else dream to make money out of it to survive that&#39;s all? I&#39;m still not living my own dream..And Yes you&#39;re also too who are watching this, we&#39;re all nothing but followers who can&#39;t make our own decision or being forced to walk on this path, just for money We&#39;re bind on a system not of human chain but humans bind in chains by Parents over them comes Society over them Government. I hate this it feels so Dark now......

Amazing that you said Java was big because it had a jvm‚Ä¶ smalltalk already had everything that Java had  but dynamic and not ugly statist typed..
I live in Russia and in our schools we still learn Pascal. I think, our government wants to make nerd-nation. In fairness, in some schools teach &quot;–ö—É–º–∏—Ä&quot;(&quot;Kumir&quot;, Idol), which like a BASIC, but in Russian and more modern with cool graphic mode, or even a Python.

(real thing to learn is how to communicate, will always stress this with devs.)<br><br>It&#39;s so stupid seeing people get hung up on tech when you can just, look at some source code and read some docs to understand how something works, where you can<br><br><b>Leverage team members who know how to use a language</b> and ask them questions to <b>understand how a language works</b> and then just, make cool shit from there.<br><br>We have mouths. We should use them, no matter how embarrassing as it is. People still come into teams where we have to assume they don&#39;t know anything, that way they can build themselves up.<br><br>Hardest dev job I had was actually not even about code, it was about <b>our middlewre infrastructure</b> and having to understand all of that mumbo jumbo with grafana, yaml files, migrating between GCP and Azure and Open shift, setting up alerts on pagerduty, and I just wanted to code, man...
wow, that escalated slowly

Excellent video, but for the joke of the last part, I want to add something too. People that think that reality is just what is inside you are worse than people in the past that thought that Earth was the center of the Universe and was 5,000 years old.<br><br><br><br>There are two realities, objective reality outside you (The Universe) and the lousy copy that your brand tries to reproduce in you (and what you have access to). There are always problems if you forget one or the other.
nice vid. to add a few that might not ought to be in the software dev ice berg, but quite interesting. between machine code and logical gate, there are register transfer level programming language like Verilog and VHDL, you can write how you want your circuit to behave and some synthesizer can transfer them into gates layout. <br><br>also for logics and math, you got things like coq and isabelle
the visuals made me crack up ahahha
What about perl?
Nice to hear someone talking about the advantages of many languages withouth need to bulshit about how one is better than other. BTW, missing the comment about my prefered language: Perl :)
Am only person who didn&#39;t notice Perl
This video was fun for old timer in the field but has no value whatsoever for people entering in the field. Don&#39;t worry and stop over thinking what to learn. The best job in this field is when your title is not programmer but you actually program to do your job. Programming is a skill and will be less and less a &quot;job&quot;.
Ada Lovelace was instructed how to take the notes she did. She is not the first programmer. She took notes in a style in which she was trained. People are only calling her the first programmer because we want to appeal to the sort female vanity which says ‚Äúus ladies are the real brains and men take all the credit‚Äù. We do that because we‚Äôd like to be loved by those women. But vain women can‚Äôt love you. So you doom yourself never to be loved.
The amount of energy - research you put in each video is amazing, it&#39;s always great to watch. especially love the way it&#39;s presented with combination of humor. cheers Jeff
HTML has as much to do with programming as Paint, it is a language tho.
This is why I realize that you must learn how to code instead of learning where to code...

PHP:  <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pEfrdAtAmqk&amp;t=194">3:14</a> &quot;and is still very popular today&quot;... wait what? Absolutly not. <br>There are still websites which are written in php because they are old and simply rewriting those would cost to much money. So actualy at this momemt in time I could not think about any reason to learn php. Everything you would need php for you can to with js aswell. Html + CSS + JS + SQL -&gt; puff web-developer. Hf

I watched this video till the end. Now Im just proud of myself for nothing.
My route was quite weird when I started. Since I saw my brother doing SystemVerilog + UVM (very, very low level languages...or hardware description languages that use digital/sequential logic for verification purposes). I had 0 knowledge of electronic or programming. Was learning it for 1.5 years and couldn&#39;t manage to get a job since I had no degree in electronics and I knew much more than interns that were applying (since I finished their courses, that are done in a team, alone). I&#39;ve been actually told by interviewers that I know much more than others but I will not be accepted only because of my degree, not even joking.<br><br>So I just started learning programming in C++ and Unreal Engine. Not even basic C++...straight into Unreal C++ and...that was painful with no knowledge of basics of C++. Couldn&#39;t get a job there since only 1 company used Unreal...so went to C# and Unity and landed a job in 3 months time.<br><br>What I want to say is that my path was completely reversed...which was a terrible idea but it just shows that you don&#39;t need to do things in order to make it it just takes a LOT longer to achieve your goal if you do it by my order. When I came to learn C#...took me a day/two and that was it. SV + UVM made me learn how computer function and how to think logically, C++ thought me how to code and think about memory and C#...thought me that things would be so much easier if I started with that (haha). <br><br>Also, learn what is popular at your country for your market. C++ was a huge mistake since no game company here uses it (except...2 right now) but it&#39;s ok to make a couple of mistakes, that&#39;s how you learn the best.
Shine on, you crazy diamond!!!

One unmentioned historical language is D. It is important because it failed to replace C++ which is why C++ is such a mess now; rather then creating progressively better languages, the ISO resorted to creating new &quot;versions&quot; of C++ which are backwards compatible like C++ is to C. These are changes just as big as the original C to C++ transition and we are on our 5th version(6th version of C) with the same name. It should be called C++++++++++++

All this research, and he fails to mention Objective-C.
We hear a lot these days about the dignity of human nature. It is quite true that man was an excellent creature when he came out of the hands of God; but if we consider this question, given fallen man, as depraved by sin, how can we join with the Psalmist, in wondering that the great God can remember him? Fallen as man is from his state of original happiness and holiness, his natural faculties and abilities are sufficient proof that the hand that made him is Divine. He is capable of great things. Your understanding, will, affections, imagination, and memory are noble and amazing faculties. But seeing him in a moral light, as an intelligent being, unceasingly dependent upon God, accountable to Him, and appointed by Him to a state of existence in an unchanging world; considering this relation, man is a monster, a vile, low, stupid, obstinate, and malicious creature; there are no words to fully describe it. Man, with all his intelligence and vaunted achievements, is a fool; while he is destitute of the saving grace of God, his conduct, as his most important concerns, are the most absurd and inconsistent, then, what the cruelest fool; concerning his affections and aims, he degrades himself far below the beasts; and by the malignity and malice of his will, he cannot be compared to anything so properly as to the devil. The question here is not about this man or that man, a Nero or an Elagabalus, but about human nature, the whole human race, except the few who are born of God. There is indeed a difference between men, but it is due to the restrictions of Divine providence, without which earth would be the very image of hell. A wolf or a lion, while in chains, cannot do much harm, as if they were released, but nature is the same in every species. Education and worry, fear and shame, human laws, and God&#39;s secret power over the mind, combine to form many personalities that are outwardly decent and respectable; and even the most lost are under a restraint that prevents them from manifesting a thousandth part of the wickedness that is in their hearts. The man is a fool. He can really measure the earth and almost count the stars; he is rich in the arts and inventions of science and politics; and shall he then be called a fool? The ancient heathens, the inhabitants of Egypt, Greece, and Rome, were eminent in this kind of wisdom. They are to this day studied as models by those who aim at excellence in history, poetry, painting, architecture, and other endeavors of human genius, which are suited to polishing the manners, without improving the heart. But its most admired philosophers, legislators, logicians, orators, and artists were as destitute as madmen or children of that one knowledge that deserves the name of true wisdom. Claiming to be wise, they became fools (Romans 1:22). Ignorant of God, but conscious of their own weakness and dependence on power above their own, and stimulated by an inward principle of fear, of which they knew neither the origin nor the right application, they worshiped the creature in Instead of the Creator, yes, they put their trust in wood and stones, in the works of men&#39;s hands, in vanities and chimeras. A familiarity with its mythology, or religious fables, passes us by a considerable branch of learning because it is drawn from ancient books, written in languages ‚Äã‚Äãnot known to the vulgar; but at the point of certainty of truth, we can receive as much satisfaction from a collection of dreams as we can from the ravings of lunatics. If, therefore, we admit these sages admiring them as tolerable specimens of humanity, shall we not confess that man, in his best condition, yet being entirely uninstructed by the Spirit of God, is a fool? But are we wiser than they are? Not at all, until the grace of God makes us so. Ourmore markedlyantages only show our madness more markedly. Why are all people counted as fools? A fool has no common sense; he is ruled entirely by appearances and prefers a fine coat to the deeds of a large estate. He doesn&#39;t consider the consequences. Fools sometimes injure or kill their best friends, and think they have done no harm. A fool cannot reason, for arguments are useless to him. At the same time, if tied with a straw, he dare not move; at another time, perhaps, he is hardly persuaded to move, though the house was on fire. Are these the characteristics of a fool? Then there is no foothe ke the sinner, who prefers the toys of the earth to the happiness of heaven, who  s held captive by the customs of the world and is more afraid of the threats of man than of the wrath of God. <br><br><br>- Rick and Morty Cartoon to show :<br>There is indeed a difference between men, but it is due to the restrictions of Divine providence, without which earth would be the very image of hell.

Have to agree with c++ blowing your whole leg off. I was doing my highschool final exam in computer science and had troubles going to the collage because I couldn&#39;t do the programming part properly. Questions were stupidly easy but I couldn&#39;t make it work, even thou I did the same type of coding at home and it went flawless. Ended up with the score of 44% (ultra bad for where I am, big sadge) (also we had like no time at all so you either did it on the first attempt or you didn&#39;t do the thing)<br>I am going to a private collage becasue of it.

All these wonder languages to replace C are nonsense. I program microcontrollers and do not find it a problem doing my own memory management. C is everywhere in the world of microcontrollers. It&#39;s usually C with a bit of the C++ for libraries. I think, like everything else, object orientated stuff was a fashion that came and went, and now it is used when it make sense to use it, rather than to create a program which can be difficult to debug. I also think working at a low level is not as tedious as many imagine because if you use a lot of high level functions you need to know their exact behaviour under all conditions or else you might get spooky behaviour which is difficult to track down. C is good because it is logical and neat. i see it like classical Greek architecture: there is no better way. What you do find time and time again though is trendy stuff that is buzz of the month say, and then disappears just as fast and these days every Tom Dick and Harry is writing a language. You will invest a lot of wasted time trying to be trendy. I learnt the hard way with M$ languages. They will leave you with code no one can maintain. They will dump it and move to an entirely incompatible system so you buy it all again. C is the Latin.

C is easier then C++? Sure the latter has much more stuff to be aware of, but in essence it&#39;s just bare bones oop, and once you wrap you head about the memory and streams shtick, all is bueno. C? Not only memory, but os calls, diy data structures and an ability to kill your OS as a bonus. No low-level is easy. You need to build with stick and stones, instead of OOP lego sets.
When I bought Turbo Pascal v3 one of its selling points was that it had eliminated the p-code virtual machine and was, finally, compiling to machine code (most of which was now calls into the language runtime in the bottom of the .COM file, but still). That was in the early eighties, and I was surprised to learn that Java had taken the retrograde step of reinventing the virtual machine.

&quot;[C++] provides many opportunities to not only shoot yourself in the foot, but blow your entire leg off. This is a reference to manual memory management with pointers&quot;<br><br>No, it isn&#39;t. You can write entire applications in C++ and not touch a pointer once. The memory management of C++ is entirely <i>unlike</i> that of C, being based instead on value/move semantics and lexically scoped allocation and destruction, which takes care of 99% of needs while keeping performance predictable and deterministic (no random GC pauses). If you&#39;re manually managing memory in C++, you&#39;re almost certainly doing something wrong. The footguns of C++ are related to the fact that it has many complex rules with many exceptions that can bite you.

Here I am, studied mathematics, did a PhD, never really did lots of programming. And now I am doing ARM assembly. But I love it. It is so close to just being math.
I was kind of hoping you would show how programming and transistors come together with HDLs, like VHDL. The difference between a concurrent and a consecutive programming language would have been a good thing to really explain. And, also maybe how assembly becomes machine code. But hey I know these things aren&#39;t important to developers, only engineers.
The only thing I really know, I know nothing!

I think that your videos are extremely educational, but you always skip an important part of becoming a programmer: learn how to understand and create algorithms comes before using a language. Coding it‚Äôs like writing, programming composing an article/essay. Learning syntax and language without understanding algorithms and system functionalities (kernels, daemons, networks, etc.) will always leave you limited don‚Äôt you think? Languages are easy to learn since they are just a tool, but the way of how to think about programming is way more important
Wow, that escalated quite fast :D

Often people ask me what programming language to learn. I always say first of all you should have a purpose and then you should select the language accordingly. For example if you wanna be a web dev then simply go for HTML, CSS and JS . For Android go for Kotlin, Swift, JS and Dart etc...

LoL that Jesus Christ convinced me to click  ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£
This was actually such a useful video with good summaries of what to learn for what and what is used for what and what language came from what. Before watching this video, all the languages seemed very confusing to me.
I&#39;ve always wanted to learn assembly
Hi
This is the best comedy channel for coders.  I laughed so hard, HOLY C~!

Beautiful work of art. Best video seem so far.
Can you do the God tier game developer roadmap
who the fuck are you man!? i just love your videos, its just too awesome sometimes, holy C man! bfuck! i am trying to break in and videos like yours are such a break to dev life frustrations
I think therefor I think I am I think, also don&#39;t count your&#39; apples before they hatch or your&#39; chickens will come home to shake their cart.
Oh God damnit, I&#39;m back to questioning if I am me. Happens every time I try learning about programming languages.
First minutes of the video: &quot;cool so many languages&quot;<br><br>Last minutes of the video: &quot;Life is suffering the only thing that we know is that we don&#39;t know nothing&quot;

what abt Dlang
I think i may quit learning Java now
i only went pascal deep and that&#39;s enough
is this good for bitcoin?
I wish I could make every 6month- programming-seminar graduate that comes through my door for an interview watch this till the end.
cant believe i got existential crisis from a programming video

That&#39;s what I call premium content.
Man assembly code rly should not be at the bottom I use that to code my arduino its easyy
rust is the ultimate soy language judging by their community. DWM is still written in C. Sorry
I can just die now üëÅüëÑüëÅ
Thank you !! Thank you for making this video.... Help me understand so much..... Thank you
I was a rare species that started with C++ and went all the way down lisp, later struggle to float up to soydev realm of javascript.
Where is pascal ?
Then my parents questioned why I left university and started to code on my own, when we went from 0 coding knowledge to scratch, to python, to assembly. Remember that the most challenging thing we did in python at that point was a search for prime numbers. I had to do a word search game using assembly.
top de mais ajudou muito
Great but you forgot Forth!!!!!
Classic!
lmfao mandlebro
No one hates Java for being typed, don&#39;t fool people. We hate it because the language design makes it objectively horrible.
thx
What an outro

I&#39;m that &quot;friend in Vietnam&quot;
I believe things got a little out of your control after the quantum section... The ultimate programming language will be that that allows the creation of connections like the human mind. But to achieve this we need first to understand more about how the human mind works. Thanks for the video.
I did grew up with programming Motorola mk68k assember then I was a kid in the 90&#39;s. After that diving into C on the UNIX.<br><br>C is still my favourite language still today and I use it for some of my own micro-services in Kubernetes. One can do both high level and low level in it, fiddle with individual bits in memory addresses or write very large modular applications.<br><br>Manual memory management have never bothered me, I never had an issue with it.

Technically assembly can be translated 1 to 1 to machine code. So learning machine code just requires a reference sheet for what the opcode for each command is.

The title was an appropriate selection for the content in this video, and I agree that this is a great representation of &quot;God-Tier Software Development&quot;.
HTML is a HyperText Markup Language, which is not a programming language as it doesn&#39;t contain instructions to be executed.
I really like the turn this video took in the end

Where is Game of Life?
Programmers can do so much with their life. But no, they decide to invent a ton of programming languages just to make their lives harder. This is when ego gets in the way. At this rate, only AI will be able to keep up with all the programming languages out there.
&quot;Chicken&quot; is missing!

Really good and interesting video. Also thanks for not calling &quot;C#&quot; &quot;Microsoft Java&quot; and saying it&#39;s only used for game development. As a full stack .NET developer this always makes me cry.<br>I&#39;ve also mingled with C and Assembly and have also written a basic bootloader and 32-bit kernel.
That ending was awesome
i know some of these words

I absolutely love your rambling.<br>I really wonder what why you need a psychologist when you can share your thoughts with the entirety of youtube!
Cute. Thanks
Iam no programmer. May ask you why most of the programming work section, if not whole, is so bad? I always read negative / pessimist comments about their jobs on programming.
Can you stop being incel
I do like it when programming and philosophy are mixed.
Knowing one language is fine.<br>Everything else you can learn when it&#39;s needed.

Yes, I know this is evaluating languages but the libraries/frameworks associated with PHP/JS two are so far apart in required skill level. PHP level 3 and JS  level 2??? PHP is an unevolved OOP joke. FP JS/TS is WAY more challenging to master. O, and I used PHP for over 15 years (CodeIgniter, Laravel, Cake, Zend, RESTful APIs, MySQL etc.). I&#39;m really glad I got away from OOP. And ye, Java (not Spring), C# etc. is also unevolved junk.<br><br>React, React (Tanstack) Query, Redux, hooks, immutability, GQL, RxJS, Chakra UI, Node.js, MongoDB VS Laravel/.NET MVC is not even remotely close in complexity.<br><br>Be careful implying that JS is easy cuz we have enough fools making chaos in our JS ecosystem thinking it&#39;s an easy language to learn.

If you can use the word &quot;knowledge&quot; and go on then you <b>know</b> perfectly well what the word means! The reason philosophers can&#39;t come up with some bloody necessary and sufficient conditions for something to be knowledge is because there is no reified essence! It&#39;s just a word with varied uses. Philosophers are just people whose intelligence has been bewitched by the form of language and now can&#39;t stop hunting for general essences and defintions.
bro went to deep
Missing Forth means missing the entire genre of stack-based languages, -- and that&#39;s an extraordinary thing to miss.  It&#39;d be like doing this and not including Prolog.  (Prolog <b>was</b> included.)  I personally think that -- for anybody who wants to implement compilers or interpreters one day, -- you have to start your education with Forth.  It&#39;s the easiest thing in the world to implement and play with, and it gets you 70% of the way there.
I learned Assembly its not hard like how its look. u just need to know the structure of ur hardware and how the computer works.
You missed out microcode which sits between machine code and transistors.
nice vid but too quick go by
Fck ..
The ending was kind of similar to that of &quot;The history of the entire world,I guess&quot;
I got a PhD in 2020 using Fortran 77 and Common Lisp.  It was like winning a street race in a &#39;57 Chevy.

javascript is a half finished buggy inconsistent half representation of half of scheme, so... no, knowing just javascript python and basic isn&#39;t enough to &quot;make anything&quot; and you can do a ton of things javascript can&#39;t do by using what javascript was made to be but embedded in the netscape browser: scheme

Programming might not rise to Hemingway&#39;s iceberg, but there is some dignity of movement. Some of the old Borland RAD tools (CBuilder, Delphi-OP, JBuilder). More fun than what ran on the 370s and DECs. Cross compilers, decompilers, disassemblers. I don&#39;t do this crap anymore.

It&#39;s good to mention that Kotlin can be used as a pure functional programming as well.<br>In Kotlin, you have first class functions where you can pass functions as parameters, assign them as values to variables and modern lambda&#39;s as well.<br>The other great feature of Kotlin which I missed in this video was the null-safety miracle which I think will put Kotlin on top of most languages today.<br>Cheers!

It&#39;s really cool you added the countries of origin of all the languages. For a lot of them I never thought they were from where they are!
I think rust should be in both high-level static and  systems, since its a viable alternative to both java/go and c++ thanks to its compiler and libary ecosystem. you  can easily combine high level cli parsing checked for safe memory management and modify a varible in ways that  can create memory leaks with c in a the same app.
your videos as always packed and factually accurate
my favourite programming language is html
I feel that some of the 2nd last and last places should swap? Not sure what the list is trying to achieve. Either from &quot;easy&quot; to &quot;hard&quot; or from &quot;high level&quot; to &quot;low&quot; level? I have a bit of experience assembly and would much rather program with that as with something like Malbolge. But anyways, keep up the good videos!

Look, there is this family of very high level languages, they are called &quot;natural languages&quot;. With them, you can actually go to one more layer of abstraction and convey poorly defined idea to programmers. <br><br>They are a bit tricky to use and you&#39;ll find a lot of weird syntax and obscure keywords, but they allow you to completely ignore the whole silicon computer machine. That being said, you still have to sort of convey your idea to a programmer. Now, programmers are carbon based devices, that interface between the carbon and the silicon world, they are fickle and whiny, but if you manage to stroke their ego the right way, you can accomplish a lot with them.

If that&#39;s not enough torture, you can go all the way down to building counters etc with transistors (They just did that to torture us during our studies).<br><br> You missed out on other abstract languages such as Labview and Isagraph, and the legendary Science and Engineering language/tool Matlab. But you covered a vast majority of what the average Software Engineer will encounter in their lifetime. It&#39;s just that Internet Articles and YouTube videos always place emphasis on Web/Game/Application/Data centric languages, when there&#39;s a whole other world out there in Software Engineering.

HTML isn&#39;t a programming language.
THE GOSPEL<br><br>Moreover, brethren, I declare unto you the gospel which I preached unto you, which also <br>ye have received, and wherein ye stand; 2 By which also ye are saved, if ye keep in memory what I preached unto you, unless ye have believed in vain. 3 For I delivered unto you first of all that which I also received, how that Christ died for our sins according to the scriptures; 4 And that he was buried, and that he rose again the third day according to the scriptures:<br>- 1 Corinthians 15: 1-4 KJV<br><br>Greater love hath no man than this, that a man lay down his life for his friends. - John 15:13 KJV<br><br>SAVALATION <br><br>For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life.<br>- John 3:16 KJV<br><br>For God sent not his Son into the world to condemn the world; but that the world through him might be saved. John 3:17<br><br>Jesus saith unto him, I am the way, the truth, and the life: no man cometh unto the Father, but by me.<br>- John 14:6 KJV<br><br>Neither is there salvation in any other: for there is none other name under heaven given among men, whereby we must be saved. Acts 4:12<br><br>For if, when we were enemies, we were reconciled to God by the death of his Son, much more, being reconciled, we shall be saved by his life. Romans 5:10<br><br>But he was wounded for our transgressions, he was bruised for our iniquities: the chastisement of our peace was upon him; and with his stripes we are healed. - Isaiah 53:5 <br><br>For by grace are ye saved through faith; and that not of yourselves: it is the gift of God: Not of works, lest any man should boast. Ephesians 2:8-9 <br><br>And saying, The time is fulfilled, and the kingdom of God is at hand: repent ye, and believe the gospel.<br>- Mark 1:15 KJV<br><br><br>He that believeth on the Son hath everlasting life: and he that believeth not the Son shall not see life; but the wrath of God abideth on him.<br>- John 3:36 KJV

what no JCL for zVSE on the list?
School is based on learning C, a bit of C++ and some ASM. It makes me feel like going backward to the programming world
Thanks for the video. Now I&#39;m going to take meds from my psychiatrist. And go learn another language.<br>Afterwards back to work, where I need to restart a vm and run a ps script. Yes, I became a senior programmer to do such things.<br>Learn programming, kids! It&#39;s fun!
This gave me existential crisis
So COBOL?
i think its funny, i skipped type systems and fell in love with functional programming. but also nice philosophical position
brooooooooo the ending !!!!!
the fact that i&#39;m understanding 99% of the content here - memes included - makes me feel very old

&quot;All but one of the programs cited in her notes had been prepared by Babbage from three to seven years earlier. The exception was prepared by Babbage for her, although she did detect a &quot;bug&quot; in it.

Hi Fireship, I enjoy your videos, but they always feel like a run-on sentence that never give me a moment to process what you&#39;re saying! I was wondering if you could introduce some little breaks instead of removing all of them.
I&#39;m currently studying JAVA, can someone tell me why a lot of people hate it? And should I continue learning it?
Make video about ABAP!
I can relate to this after working with Java dart Swift c# i really don&#39;t wanna go any further üòÖüòÖ

There is an a Indian language is <br>Bhaie language don&#39;t know Google it
As someone that knows VHDL and Verilog and uses it to build firmware based circuits from demand If find this video cute.
what I would like to see is a language so intuitive and easy to write in that anybody could pick it up and make what they wish in a short amount of time.<br>this is not an impossible task, it is quite achievable. if we thought and spoke in binary this would have been achieved the moment we made the first computer. the goal of a programming language is to translate binary to english and english back to binary, each programming language we make is just a new intermediary language designed to make translation easier.<br>this task would be far easier if the program language developers looked at the problem in the opposite direction they do. if instead of starting with binary and translating to english, they started with english and translated to binary, it would be a lot easier to do.
The transition from one language to another was really good.<br><br>Didn&#39;t knew there are so many languages between C++ and asm
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pEfrdAtAmqk&amp;t=17">0:17</a> Not a roadmap, but watching this video is literally all you need.
My two favorite languages to code in are Python and ASM. What does that say about me?
TFW you move UP the iceberg as you get older because you just wanna build dopey web games and get paid to read API documentation
This is a masterpiece

Programming language levels are all about<br><br>&quot;There is this language. It&#39;s cool and all.&quot;<br><i>...but Microsoft created a better one</i>
This video literally F*cked  my brain.
As a mathematician having things like ZFC and Coq at the bottom are dumb af.
My path into software was ideal in retrospect, because I never even started out in school as a software engineer or computer science major, I graduated with an EE who started with C, then C++ (good times doing dynamic gui&#39;s with wxwidgets :O ), and i vaguely remember taking a java course one semester.  Among all the typical Math, Physics and electronics classes, i stumbled across assembly, mips, risc, arm, and x86 and i thought it was cool that I could see how the instruction sets come to be, and how the transistor layouts that they were drilling into us really did make the foundation of modern computer tech. <br><br>Things like how a half adder could be chained to a full adder, and how that could be expanded to make a 32 bit register, and how you could ultimately make an ALU just by stacking these simple parts together, and finally how the CPU is constructed and how opcodes are defined.  Playing the game of swapping C to assembly or vice versa cracked that insight boundary for me, and my job after graduating was data engineering with python, which is still the main language i use today. Bash and Python have served me well :) and Im very happy that the ground up approach I ended up doing, going from the learning the circuits, to the digital logic, to the physical Hardware and finally to the Software really helped me to understand the capabilities and limitations of these languages and really appreciate what it is im doing when im executing code. idk why I wrote all this lmao
Existential crisis on another level
Everyone&#39;s happy until someone pulls out assembly code
you can use vhdl or verilog to describe hardware to fpga, like html describes a websites, this describes logic gates in the fpga. (you can ad this).
Did you make pact in 100 seconds yet?

You had the Camel up in the graphic but no mention of Perl, sorry Larry I guess it truly is dead.

Ha. cuz Aaron Rodgers did drugs. I get it
When you mentioned that each programming languages has its own iceberg, I very interested in that possible video
I don&#39;t remember Perl being mentioned...

Kotlin is not for mobile only, it&#39;s an OO and a functional language that can be used for many purposes
The next logical step after reaching the bottom of the iceberg is to find out in which language our universe is written. After that, become God.

ps: yauasca you dont trip, quite the oposite, it removes the fog so you can see everything as is, some see as trip cause they lived 99.99999% of their lives inside the fog and now when everything is cristal clear is hard to absorve the world without the billion of mental noises they are used to
Ya by the end you are programming in the simulation language by doing different doses of shrooms and other variables like Lsd lol
surprised you didn&#39;t mention perl :)
This is gold. The ending is fantastic. Thanks for making my evening cold bath that much more enjoyable. Hilarious yet informative.
This was fucking pure gold.

The real trick to being successful in the programming industry is learning the fundamentals of programming itself, and then applying that knowledge to whatever programming language the job itself requires. At the end of the day, almost all programming languages have similar workflow with minor differences in syntax. Limiting yourself to one language is a great way to corner yourself in a small job market with little to no growth potential.
this was such a dense 16 minutes, i didn&#39;t even move my head while watching
dud, u rly know nothing, huge dis for skipping perl and furier transforms that make bits in your ripple carry adders :D

Computer Science student here, I think it&#39;s a little bit odd to put Assembly at the bottom of the iceberg, because you&#39;ll be expected to learn it in at least one class to get your Bachelors. Interestingly, I don&#39;t think my degree program has me learning any functional languages, possibly because they have yet to update the cirriculum. As for transistors, you might be learning that in your CS program too if it&#39;s not a part of the Computer Engineering program or Electrical Engineering.<br><br>Personally if I was making the iceberg go from &quot;languages you will learn&quot; to &quot;languages you will only learn if you really want to get deep into it&quot;, I&#39;d keep Scratch at the top, followed by Python and Javascript. Basic wouldn&#39;t be at the top since nobody AFAIK uses it to learn programming anymore. HTML or CSS might honestly be in the same tier as Python and Javascript. C++ and Java would be a level below those &quot;beginner languages&quot;, with Assembly only one level below that. Functional languages might honestly belong at the same tier as either C++ and Java or Assembly depending on how popular they really are. The esoteric languages really belong at the bottom here; you&#39;d never program in them unless you just wanted to have a good laugh.<br><br>It&#39;s important to distinguish between how easy it is to program in these languages and how common it is to program in them. Depending on the application, it&#39;s actually fairly easy to program in Assembly if you aren&#39;t having to solve complex math problems (each individual arithmetic operation has to be on its own line in Assembly) and you keep track of which memory caches are in use. The instructions aren&#39;t as easy to read as a high-level language, of course, but the syntax is surprisingly simple, no weird confusing parenthesees or pointers to struggle with. I imagine the same thing applies to some extent to transistors, although in that &quot;language&quot; your mistakes may have the unintended side effect of damaging your components.

That make all the other soy-based-languages possible
Awww, you skipped over Perl!<br><br>IMHO, perl shouldn&#39;t have been in the same tier as prolog, ADA, Pascal and all that. But I am biased.
As always you didn&#39;t mention D (Dlang), a good successor to C/C++ and a good alternative to Go and Rust.
I started with C then Java to do Standalone Application leaned SQL and then PL/SQL, now doing C++ and Unix in the company I got recruited with because of Java technology :V

I love when you do off beat videos like this, My favorite part has to be the section at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pEfrdAtAmqk&amp;t=711">11:51</a> but I think one of the amazing language you missed out here was Folders, where you express the code by creating Folders that follow a certain structure.
Can&#39;t believe we skipped the turing machine and lambda calculus

Just Awesome
You definitely missed DNA as a codding language. It should be right in between transistors and quantum electrodynamics. And maybe organic chemistry after DNA too. <br>Also transistors actually can represent three states: Connected to Hi (+Vcc), Low (-Vcc or ground), and high impedance state e.g. not connected.
I am sad that people have completely forgotten about LOGO, the inventor of turtle graphics. It&#39;s a serious alternative to BASIC.

You are the first one to suggest using Scratch as a beginner!!! I used it for a few months and I don&#39;t regret it, as it is the reason I got into computers. Scratch is GREAT!

Been coding for 30 years or more, pro for more than 20. I enjoyed the video itself, but the ending, that&#39;s where you get my ‚ù§<br>Hadn&#39;t really realized how much overlap there might be with members of my profession and ending up down a rabbit hole of existential concerns
Last bit was exact quotes from indian ancient literature and its exposition with its one of main idea/concept called &quot;Maya&quot;.The literature behind it greatly influenced Matrix movie series which was even acknowledged in interviews by Matrix movie creators
Existential questions aside, this is a great way to organize the mountain of coding languages -- especially as a junior developer who kinda wants to try everything new all the time. Maybe the single most helpful video for answering &quot;what language should I learn next?&quot; Thank you!
vlang seems off, no explanation anywhere how it does its memory managment

have you included thyme? the programming language people can use on Algodoo.
that got existential very quickly
Quick question, everyone that I know is going into CS, IT... just like hundreds of thousands of other clueless highschool grats, how will this affect us? Not in 2-4 years but im talking about in 5-10 years

I guess way better than Python+Numpy.<br>About most loved languages. I guess you really have to love Rust to use it. So it&#39;s the most loved by a cult of developers which use it voluntarily. I have to use C++, I don&#39;t like so many things about it that I can&#39;t even remember which I hate the most, but I use it professionally and it can do almost everything in it (after messing with CMake files to integrate few 3rd party libraries for days while by this time you do the same in Python without using it ever before)

I‚Äôd argue that a programming language is a language for programming.  HTML is a hierarchical hypertext content description language, and CSS is a visual styling language, and together they can technically be used as a Turing-complete programming language, but only in the most esoteric proof-of-concept experiments.  They weren‚Äôt designed for procedural execution and 99.999% of the time they aren‚Äôt used that way.  Just because you can use something for something else doesn‚Äôt mean it is that‚Äî a car isn‚Äôt a shoe even though you could technically park 2 convertibles next to each other and ‚Äúwear‚Äù them as ‚Äúshoes‚Äù.  Same argument for SQL‚Äî it‚Äôs a database query language that technically has enough stuff from programming languages in it that you could write a program with it (with lots of caveats), but no one ever will for any practical purpose because it would be a horribly slow, memory-hogging, convoluted, barely-functional mess and there‚Äôs 100s of actual programming tools available in every environment.

All the basic programming courses at my university used Scala so I actually started my programming journey from level 5 of this tier list. I think it was a great language to start with, still love it.
Holy shit .
Waiting for the tutorial
I am just seeing your work and research for this video. Exquisite brother. You&#39;re an inspiration.
The Hog Rider card is unlocked from the Spell Valley (Arena 5). He is a very fast building-targeting, melee troop with moderately high hitpoints and damage. He appears just like his Clash of Clans counterpart; a man with brown eyebrows, a beard, a mohawk, and a golden body piercing in his left ear who is riding a hog. A Hog Rider card costs 4 Elixir to deploy.<br><br>Strategy<br><br>His fast move speed can boost forward mini tanks like an Ice Golem in a push. At the same time, he can also function as a tank for lower hitpoint troops such as Goblins as he still has a fair amount of health. Most cheap swarms complement the Hog Rider well, as they are nearly as fast as him and usually force more than one card out of the opponent&#39;s hand.<br><br>The Hog Rider struggles with swarms, as they can damage him down and defeat him quickly while obstructing his path. Barbarians in particular can fully counter him without very strict timing on the defender&#39;s part, though be wary of spells.<br><br>A Hunter can kill the Hog Rider in 2 hits if placed right on top of it. However, if you place something in front of the Hog Rider, the Hunter&#39;s splash will damage the Hog Rider and hit the card in front of it more.<br><br>The Hog Rider in conjunction with the Freeze can surprise the opponent and allow the Hog Rider to deal much more damage than anticipated, especially if the opponent&#39;s go-to counter is a swarm, or swarms are their only effective counter to him. Skeletons and Bats will immediately be defeated by the spell, while Spear Goblins, Goblins, and Minions will be at low enough health to be defeated by a follow up Zap or Giant Snowball.<br><br>However, this strategy isn&#39;t very effective against buildings as the Hog Rider will take a while to destroy the building, giving the opponent ample time to articulate another counter.<br><br>Against non-swarm troops, it can deal a lot of damage during the freeze time, but this can allow the opponent to set up a massive counterpush. For this reason, players should either only go for a Hog Rider + Freeze when they have other units backing it up from a counterattack, or if the match is about to end and they need to deal as much damage as possible.<br><br>It is not a good idea to send in a Hog Rider simply to destroy a building, especially if it is the only building targeting unit available, as defeating Crown Towers becomes substantially more difficult. Spells or simply waiting out the lifetime of the building are more effective. The exception to this is an Elixir Collector placed in front of the King&#39;s Tower. If a Hog Rider placed at the bridge, he can destroy the Collector for a positive Elixir trade, though the damage from both Princess Towers will usually mean he does not survive to deal any damage to them. However, if the opponent sends in defending troops, it can be an opportunity to gain spell damage value.<br><br>In a deck with several low-cost cards, it might be worth it to simply send the Hog Rider against one building. These decks shuffle their card rotation quick enough, that they will arrive to their next Hog Rider before the next building arrives in the opponent&#39;s card rotation.<br><br>Long-ranged troops like Musketeer and Flying Machine can snipe those buildings, preserving some of the Hog Rider&#39;s health, possibly allowing it to get some Tower damage.<br><br>When there are buildings placed in the middle to counter the Hog Rider, understanding the placement of the Hog Rider and the type of building placed can help the Hog Rider to bypass certain buildings.<br><br>Passive buildings such as spawners and Elixir Collector have a larger hitbox than defensive buildings; which means that if a passive building was placed 3 tiles away from the river in the middle of the opponent&#39;s side, then it is impossible for the Hog Rider to bypass that placement as the Hog Rider will get pulled to that building.<br><br>Defensive buildings have a smaller hitbox than a passive building, which means if that if a defensive building was placed three tiles away from the river in the middle of the opponent&#39;s side, a Hog Rider placed at the very left or right side of the Arena may be able to bypass it due to its smaller hitbox.<br><br>If the player has a building already placed down in the center of the arena, and the opponent tries to bypass it with a Hog Rider at the edge of the arena, they can use certain air troops to push the Hog Rider towards the building as it jumps over the river, effectively denying the bypass attempt. They must be already hovering over the correct placement, as very quick reflexes are required to correctly perform this technique.<br><br>For Bats, Skeleton Dragons, and Minion Horde, they should be placed right in front of the Hog Rider as soon as it is deployed.<br><br>For Minions, Skeleton Barrel, Mega Minion, Flying Machine, Electro Dragon, Baby Dragon, Inferno Dragon, Balloon, and Lava Hound, stagger the above placement one tile to the right if the Hog Rider is placed on the left side of the arena, and vice versa.<br><br>They can also use ground troops to achieve the same result. Something like an Ice Golem deployed at the Hog Rider‚Äôs landing spot will obstruct his path and force him to go around the unit, which causes him to be closer to the building instead of the Crown Tower.<br><br>The Hog Rider can kite Very Fast non-building targeting troops due to his own Very Fast speed and building only targeting if he is placed on the fourth tile from the bridge, slightly into the opposite lane. He can also stall grounded units when placed right at the bridge. He will pull them towards him while deploying, and then be untargetable by them when he jumps over the bridge. After landing, he will pull them back. This can be useful when the player needs to deal damage in the same lane they are defending. It will also help separate troops behind a tank in a large push.<br><br>A Tornado placed on the second tile front of the player&#39;s King&#39;s Tower and staggered two tiles towards the Princess Tower will activate it without any damage dealt to the Princess Tower, helping them in defending future pushes. This can also be a method of mitigating all damage dealt to a Princess Tower, but doing this more than three times may result in the King&#39;s Tower&#39;s health being low enough to be targeted directly, opening up the possible threat of a back door three crown. A better alternative is to pull the Hog away from the Princess Tower into the attacking range of all three Crown Towers, which will negate all damage as long as none of them are already distracted<br><br>A very powerful combo is the Hog Rider, the Musketeer, and the Valkyrie, typically referred to as the Trifecta. The Musketeer will defend against most troops, while the Valkyrie can protect her and the Hog Rider from swarms or high damage units. The Hog Rider is used to deal damage to the tower.<br><br>This can be effectively countered by Lightning, one-shotting the Musketeer and severely damaging both the Valkyrie and Hog Rider. The Minion Horde is also effective, but the enemy can Zap them and the Musketeer will one-shot them all. Even if the Musketeer is defeated, the Hog Rider and Valkyrie will have enough time to severely damage the Tower.<br><br>The Hog Rider should be placed behind the Valkyrie to give it a boost so that it stays in front of the Hog Rider, protecting it.<br><br>A Hog Rider combined with a Goblin Barrel can be awkward for the opponent to defend against. Timing it so that the Hog Rider is tanking the tower shots for the Goblins is the most effective way to deal damage. However, a Barbarian Barrel can shut this down with minimal Tower damage for a positive Elixir trade, as long as the Goblin Barrel was placed directly on the Tower.<br><br>Pairing the Hog Rider with the Balloon can deal devastating damage. If executed properly, the Hog Rider will act as a tank while the Balloon threatens to deal massive damage. The Hog Rider can also destroy any buildings attempting to slow down the combo. However, this combo is very vulnerable to swarms and anti-air cards as neither of the troops target anything but buildings. Additionally, they are easy to separate, due to the disparity in move speeds. Alternatively, the Hog Rider and the Balloon can be played in different lanes to spread the opponent&#39;s defenses thin. However, a building or Tornado can bring them back together for an easier defense.<br><br>The Hog Rider can be paired with the Lumberjack as both a swarm bait and damage combo. It is a very fast combo with an extremely high damage output potential, so the enemy will likely try to counter it with a swarm. If this happens, use a spell like Arrows to render the opponent defenseless. If they manage to defeat the Lumberjack, the dropped Rage will make the Hog Rider even more dangerous than it normally is.<br><br>A fast and deadly combination is the Hog Rider and Mini P.E.K.K.A. combo. Both units are fast but the Mini P.E.K.K.A. does much more damage and does not attack only buildings so the Mini P.E.K.K.A. can deal with troops like the Executioner and Musketeer. However, this combo can be defeated with swarms like Skeleton Army, which will defeat both of them since neither of them can deal area damage. They are also unable to target air troops, so the Minion Horde can stop this easily.<br><br>A risky play is to deploy the Hog Rider at the bridge as soon as the match starts. If the opponent does not react fast enough, the Hog Rider will deal a significant amount of damage to the Princess Tower. This can also allow the player to quickly scout the opponent&#39;s deck if they happen to react to him fast enough.
Well that escalated quickly and now to ponder my existence...
You should mention ColdFusion.<br><br>A language that is similar to java but feels like PHP üòÇ

I want to learn every language now.
There is a Ada, general purpose language named after Ada Lovelace who is generally considered the world&#39;s first computer programmer. It was extremely popular in the 1980s and is still used today by the department of defense to blow people up <br><br>so so sad and funny <br>üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ
Definitely, that the logic gates are Minecraft redstones.
fuck , i am done at 11 minute , cant take more ,,,,,
Just wanted to throw it out there because I think it&#39;s such a weird criticism, but in Haskell a monoid is just a type that you can do map on and a monad is just a type you can do flatmap on. For technical reasons that you don&#39;t need to worry about, this enables some syntactic sugar. That&#39;s basically all there is to it.
F# compiles to Javascript also (and soon to Python, Rust &amp; Dart)
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pEfrdAtAmqk&amp;t=804">13:24</a> ‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs pronounced &#39;peet&#39;, not &#39;pee et&#39;. Kind of had to cringe as a Dutch speaker when I heard that mispronunciation üòÖ

I really like the ending ü§£ didn&#39;t expected it
I think you should do a more Indepth video on Ada. Rust is a compiler that will whack you round the head if your memory is unsafe, however Ada whacks you round the head when your logic is unsafe. The last thing you want in your military/life critical hardware is for a bug to crop up when you need it to work, especially when you can&#39;t practically test it, such as with a nuke, or doing so may kill someone if things go wrong. Not only does the military use it; railway, infostructure, aviation and medical equipment also still use it today, because of its insistence on making sure your code is logically coherent throughout.
Best programming video on youtube! üòÇüòÑ
It&#39;ll be my way. ‚úäÔ∏è I must learn basic, then I&#39;ll learn assembler x86. It&#39;ll be my best CV for Microsoft or Google. Profit

At the transistor level you can also use SPICE to &#39;code it&#39;

No worries, all words he said at the end are also illusions... wait a minUTE... FU-
PowerShell, although very specific, is one of my favorite languages, it&#39;s remotely similar to php and the syntax is very unique
What is knowledge? That&#39;s actually a good question... Specially with all this machine learning algorithms that can &quot;learn&quot; how to resolve an objective...
Lua should probably be deeper on the ice berg, it&#39;s a fairly dead language and metatables can get quite arcane.
suddenly I wanted to try to write a website on a SCRATCH!
In case you were curious, a competent university CS program will take you through most of the layers in this iceberg, except for the esoteric languages. You don&#39;t necessarily need a degree for a job these days, but it does give you most of this knowledge.
I never knew that python was created in the Netherlands :o
Great video! where is MatLab XD
Now I got a video to put my colleagues in high level statically unspoken confusion

You missed Verilog, SystemVerilog at the very bottom level, it is used to program registers and logic gates. I used to be a hardware engineer turning software algorithms into hardware accelerator using Verilog. And now I am writing Javascript React :).
Thank you for the existential crisis at the end there. Really needed it :)
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pEfrdAtAmqk&amp;t=522">8:42</a> here is an explanation of how autofree works:<br><br>- The compiler does &quot;escape analysis&quot; (in quotes, because real escape analysis is a lot more complicated)<br>- For each block: call free on values that do not escape this block.<br>- For all values that may escape and thus cannot be freed: allocate them with boehm GC or do ARC or whatever (on the V website it just says &quot;GC&quot;).<br><br>This reminds me of something... You know, like putting `__attribute__((malloc))` on a C function and having GCC do the escape analysis on my GC object...<br><br>And what essentially <b>every</b> garbage-collected language does for performance...<br><br>But if you say it&#39;s innovative on the website, make the description vague and don&#39;t really say what it is (poorly done escape analysis), you might sucker people into donating.
This will become a mandatory coffee break watch of first lesson of my beginners OOP course. Genius!
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pEfrdAtAmqk&amp;t=736">12:16</a> This is untrue, in INTERCAL the PLEASE keyword does do something. From wikipedia,<br>    If &quot;PLEASE&quot; does not appear often enough, the program is considered insufficiently polite, and the error message says this; if it appears too often, the program could be rejected as excessively polite. Although this feature existed in the original INTERCAL compiler, it was undocumented.
